## ðŸ“‹ Important Note

As part of our project structure optimization, all batch scripts have been moved to this `tools/` directory. 
The root directory now only contains two essential scripts:
- `unified-ai.bat` - Unified management tool for human users
- `ai-runner.bat` - Automated tool for AI agents

To use any of the tools listed above, you can either:
1. Run them directly with their full path: `tools\script-name.bat`
2. Use the unified management tool: `unified-ai.bat` (recommended)

## CLI Tools

The Unified AI Project provides several CLI tools for interacting with the system:

### Unified CLI
General AI interactions with the backend services:
```bash
# Check system health
cli-runner.bat unified-cli health

# Chat with AI
cli-runner.bat unified-cli chat "Hello, how are you?"

# Analyze code
cli-runner.bat unified-cli analyze --code "def hello(): print('Hello')"
```

### AI Models CLI
Model management and interactions with various AI models:
```bash
# List available models
cli-runner.bat ai-models-cli list

# Check model health
cli-runner.bat ai-models-cli health

# Query AI models
cli-runner.bat ai-models-cli query "Explain quantum computing"

# Enter chat mode
cli-runner.bat ai-models-cli chat --model gpt-4
```

### HSP CLI
Hyper-Structure Protocol tools for advanced interactions:
```bash
# Query using HSP
cli-runner.bat hsp-cli query "Hello"

# Publish facts via HSP
cli-runner.bat hsp-cli publish_fact "The sky is blue" --confidence 0.9
```

### Installing CLI as System Command
You can install the CLI tools as system commands:
```bash
# Install CLI package
cli-runner.bat install-cli
```

After installation, you can use the `unified-ai` command from anywhere:
```bash
unified-ai --help
unified-ai health
unified-ai chat "Hello"
```
