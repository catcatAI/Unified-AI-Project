# Project Status Summary

This document provides a summary of the current status of the Unified AI Project, highlighting both completed and incomplete components. This analysis is based on a review of the codebase, existing documentation, and code comments.

## 1. Architectural Notes

The system is a multi-agent AI project with a distributed, service-oriented architecture. Key components include:
- **HSP (Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol)**: An MQTT-based communication backbone for all components.
- **HAM (Hierarchical Abstractive Memory)**: A sophisticated, layered memory architecture.
- **Multi-LLM Service**: A dedicated service for interacting with multiple LLM providers.
- **Core Services Hub**: A central script (`src/core_services.py`) for initializing and managing core components.

## 未完成 (Unfinished)

These items represent unfinished functionality or are pending future work.

*   **HSP Schema URIs**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/hsp/connector.py`
    *   **Architectural Context**: The HSP specification (`docs/03-technical-architecture/communication/hsp-specification/02-message-envelope-and-patterns.md`) defines a `payload_schema_uri` field in the message envelope. This field is intended to link to a schema that defines the structure of the message payload.
    *   **Description**: The `payload_schema_uri` field in outgoing HSP message envelopes is currently populated with hardcoded placeholder strings (e.g., `"hsp:schema:payload/Fact/0.1"`).
    *   **Status**: This represents a gap in the implementation of the HSP specification. The functionality awaits the formal definition and hosting of message payload schemas. This is a significant architectural task.
    *   **Analysis & Recommendation (as of 2025-08-04)**:
        *   **Schema Definition**: JSON Schemas should be defined for each payload type (`Fact`, `TaskRequest`, `TaskResult`, `CapabilityAdvertisement`, etc.) to accurately describe their data structure and types.
        *   **Schema Hosting**: It is recommended to create a `schemas` directory within the project to store these JSON Schema files, allowing them to be version-controlled alongside the code.
        *   **URI Format**: The `payload_schema_uri` can then use a file-based URI (e.g., `file:///schemas/fact_v0.1.json`) or an HTTP-based URI if the schemas are to be hosted on a server in the future.
        *   **Next Steps**: This task requires further architectural decisions on schema design and hosting strategy before implementation can proceed. It is currently blocked pending these decisions.

*   **Incomprehensive Health Check**:
    *   **File**: `scripts/health_check.py`
    *   **Architectural Context**: The health check script is a standalone utility for verifying the status of the system's components.
    *   **Description**: The script currently checks the main API server and the existence of the Firebase credentials file. It contains placeholder functions for checking the health of the MQTT broker and the database.
    *   **Status**: The current health check is not comprehensive. The placeholder functions need to be implemented to provide a full picture of the system's health.

## 已完成 (Completed)

These components are implemented and functioning as expected, or have been investigated and clarified.

*   **Core Feature Implementations**: Several key TODOs outlined in `docs/06-project-management/planning/todo-placeholders.md` have been addressed.

*   **Data Anomaly Clarification**: The presence of `"XXX"` substrings in `data/processed_data/dialogue_context_memory.json` has been investigated and clarified.

*   **Minor Code Quality Fixes**:
    *   Removed a duplicated `OverwriteDecision` enum in `apps/backend/src/shared/types/common_types.py`.
    *   Refactored the Electron app's `main.js` and `renderer.js` to use modern ES6+ syntax.

*   **Electron App Enhancements**:
    *   **State Management**: Implemented a centralized state management system.
    *   **IPC Communication**: Refactored the IPC communication to be more structured and maintainable.
    *   **UI Component Library**: Created a simple UI component library and refactored the UI to use it.
    *   **Responsive Layout**: Implemented a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   **User Feedback**: Implemented a user feedback and notification system.
    *   **History and Session Management**: Implemented a system for saving and restoring user sessions and conversation history.
    *   **Security Hardening**: Implemented several security best practices for Electron applications.

## 已失效 (Invalid / By Design)

These items are not pending tasks but are either intentional design choices or no longer relevant.

*   **Configuration Placeholders**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/configs/api_keys.yaml`
    *   **Description**: This file contains placeholder values for various API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`). This is **intentional** for security reasons. The system is designed to load actual keys from environment variables at runtime.
