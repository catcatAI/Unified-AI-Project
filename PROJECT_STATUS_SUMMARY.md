# Project Status Summary

This document provides a summary of the current status of the Unified AI Project, highlighting both completed and incomplete components. This analysis is based on a review of the codebase, existing documentation, and code comments.

## 1. Architectural Notes

The system is a multi-agent AI project with a distributed, service-oriented architecture. Key components include:
- **HSP (Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol)**: An MQTT-based communication backbone for all components.
- **HAM (Hierarchical Abstractive Memory)**: A sophisticated, layered memory architecture.
- **Multi-LLM Service**: A dedicated service for interacting with multiple LLM providers.
- **Core Services Hub**: A central script (`src/core_services.py`) for initializing and managing core components.

## 2. Completed Items

These components are implemented and functioning as expected, or have been investigated and clarified.

*   **Core Feature Implementations**: Several key TODOs outlined in `docs/06-project-management/planning/todo-placeholders.md` have been addressed:
    *   **Tool Name Resolution**: The `get_tool_structure` method in `src/core_ai/code_understanding/lightweight_code_model.py` can now correctly resolve tool names to filepaths.
    *   **Service Discovery Staleness**: The `ServiceDiscoveryModule` now correctly handles the expiration of stale service capabilities.
    *   **HSP Connector Robustness**: The `HSPConnector` now relies on the Paho MQTT client's built-in reconnection logic, and the 'received' ACK mechanism is implemented.
    *   **Electron App UI**: A "Use Service" button has been successfully added to the Electron app's HSP service list.

*   **Data Anomaly Clarification**: The presence of `"XXX"` substrings in `data/processed_data/dialogue_context_memory.json` has been investigated. It has been confirmed that these are coincidental artifacts of the data processing pipeline and **not** placeholders for missing data.

*   **Minor Code Quality Fix**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/shared/types/common_types.py`
    *   **Description**: Removed a duplicated `OverwriteDecision` enum definition.

## 3. Incomplete Items & Placeholders

These items are either intentionally left as placeholders, are pending future work, or represent unfinished functionality.

*   **Configuration Placeholders**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/configs/api_keys.yaml`
    *   **Description**: This file contains placeholder values for various API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`). This is **intentional** for security reasons. The system is designed to load actual keys from environment variables at runtime.

*   **HSP Schema URIs**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/hsp/connector.py`
    *   **Architectural Context**: The HSP specification (`docs/03-technical-architecture/communication/hsp-specification/02-message-envelope-and-patterns.md`) defines a `payload_schema_uri` field in the message envelope. This field is intended to link to a schema that defines the structure of the message payload.
    *   **Description**: The `payload_schema_uri` field in outgoing HSP message envelopes is currently populated with hardcoded placeholder strings (e.g., `"hsp:schema:payload/Fact/0.1"`).
    *   **Status**: This represents a gap in the implementation of the HSP specification. The functionality awaits the formal definition and hosting of message payload schemas. This is a significant architectural task.

*   **Incomprehensive Health Check**:
    *   **File**: `scripts/health_check.py`
    *   **Architectural Context**: The health check script is a standalone utility for verifying the status of the system's components.
    *   **Description**: The script currently checks the main API server and the existence of the Firebase credentials file. It contains placeholder functions for checking the health of the MQTT broker and the database.
    *   **Status**: The current health check is not comprehensive. The placeholder functions need to be implemented to provide a full picture of the system's health.

*   **Electron App Enhancements**:
    *   **File**: `docs/interfaces/ELECTRON_APP_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
    *   **Description**: This document outlines a detailed roadmap for significant UI, feature, and code structure improvements for the Electron desktop application.
    *   **Status**: The app is functional, but it is not considered feature-complete. This represents a large body of future work.
