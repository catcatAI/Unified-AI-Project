# Project Status Summary

This document provides a summary of the current status of the Unified AI Project, highlighting both completed and incomplete components. This analysis is based on a review of the codebase, existing documentation, and code comments.

## 1. Completed Items

These components are implemented and functioning as expected, or have been investigated and clarified.

*   **Core Feature Implementations**: Several key TODOs outlined in `docs/06-project-management/planning/todo-placeholders.md` have been addressed:
    *   **Tool Name Resolution**: The `get_tool_structure` method in `src/core_ai/code_understanding/lightweight_code_model.py` can now correctly resolve tool names to filepaths.
    *   **Service Discovery Staleness**: The `ServiceDiscoveryModule` now correctly handles the expiration of stale service capabilities.
    *   **HSP Connector Robustness**: The `HSPConnector` now relies on the Paho MQTT client's built-in reconnection logic, and the 'received' ACK mechanism is implemented.
    *   **Electron App UI**: A "Use Service" button has been successfully added to the Electron app's HSP service list.

*   **Data Anomaly Clarification**: The presence of `"XXX"` substrings in `data/processed_data/dialogue_context_memory.json` has been investigated. It has been confirmed that these are coincidental artifacts of the data processing pipeline and **not** placeholders for missing data.

## 2. Incomplete Items & Placeholders

These items are either intentionally left as placeholders, are pending future work, or represent unfinished functionality.

*   **Configuration Placeholders**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/configs/api_keys.yaml`
    *   **Description**: This file contains placeholder values for various API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`). This is **intentional** for security reasons. The system is designed to load actual keys from environment variables at runtime.

*   **HSP Schema URIs**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/hsp/connector.py`
    *   **Description**: The `payload_schema_uri` field in outgoing HSP message envelopes is currently populated with hardcoded placeholder strings (e.g., `"hsp:schema:payload/Fact/0.1"`).
    *   **Status**: This is a known work-in-progress. The functionality awaits the formal definition and hosting of message payload schemas.

*   **Incomprehensive Health Check**:
    *   **File**: `scripts/health_check.py`
    *   **Description**: The script contains a `TODO` comment indicating that it lacks checks for critical services such as the MQTT broker or a database.
    *   **Status**: The current health check is not comprehensive and needs to be extended to provide a full picture of the system's health.

*   **Electron App Enhancements**:
    *   **File**: `docs/interfaces/ELECTRON_APP_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
    *   **Description**: This document outlines a detailed roadmap for significant UI, feature, and code structure improvements for the Electron desktop application.
    *   **Status**: The app is functional, but it is not considered feature-complete.

*   **Minor Code Quality Issues**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/shared/types/common_types.py`
    *   **Description**: The file contains a duplicated `OverwriteDecision` enum definition.
    *   **Status**: This is a minor issue that should be addressed in a future code cleanup.
