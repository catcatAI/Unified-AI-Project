## 🎯 Remaining Issues

### ~~Desktop App - WebSocket Implementation~~ ✅ FIXED

**File**: `apps/desktop-app/electron_app/main.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**What Was Wrong**: The WebSocket client code had placeholder comments that only
returned fake success:

```javascript
ipcMain.on('websocket-connect', (event, { url }) => {
  // Connect to backend WebSocket
  // Will use ws or WebSocket library
  event.reply('websocket-connected', { success: true })
})
```

**What Was Fixed**:

1. ✅ Added `ws` library to package.json dependencies
2. ✅ Implemented full WebSocket client with:
   - Real connection to backend at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`
   - Auto-reconnection logic (max 5 attempts)
   - Message handling (send/receive)
   - Error handling and status reporting
   - Auto-connect on app startup
3. ✅ Verified backend has WebSocket server at `/ws` endpoint

**Result**: Desktop app can now communicate with backend properly
