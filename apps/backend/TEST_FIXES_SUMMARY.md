# Unified AI Project - Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve test failures in the Unified AI Project backend.

## 1. LightweightCodeModel Test Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- `analyze_tool_file` method was being called with an extra `None` parameter
- Test cases were failing due to parameter mismatch in mock functions

### Changes Made:
- Modified `get_tool_structure` method in `lightweight_code_model.py` to correctly handle `dna_chain_id` parameter
- Updated test cases in `test_lightweight_code_model.py` to ensure `side_effect_analyzer` function accepts the correct number of parameters

## 2. AlphaDeepModel Learning Mechanism Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- Feedback symbols were not being properly created/returned in the `learn` method
- Test was failing because `feedback_symbol` was unexpectedly `None`

### Changes Made:
- Modified `learn` method in `alpha_deep_model.py` to properly create and return feedback symbols
- Updated method signature to indicate it returns an optional value
- Modified test case in `test_alpha_deep_model.py` to correctly check for returned feedback symbol

## 3. DialogueManager Test Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- Error responses were not matching expected values
- Memory manager call counts were not as expected

### Changes Made:
- Updated error handling in `get_simple_response` method in `dialogue_manager.py` to return consistent error messages
- Adjusted test assertions in `test_dialogue_manager.py` to properly check for memory manager calls

## 4. ProjectCoordinator Test Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- `get_all_capabilities` was not being properly awaited in tests
- Method name mismatch between synchronous and asynchronous versions

### Changes Made:
- Fixed method call in `project_coordinator.py` to use the correct asynchronous method
- Updated mock setup in `conftest.py` to ensure `get_all_capabilities` is properly mocked as an async method

## 5. Test Configuration Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- Mock services were not properly configured for testing
- Some methods were not correctly mocked as async methods

### Changes Made:
- Updated `conftest.py` to properly configure mock services
- Ensured async methods are correctly mocked with `AsyncMock`

## Verification

To verify these fixes, run the test suite:

```bash
cd D:\Projects\Unified-AI-Project\apps\backend
python -m pytest
```

Or use the provided batch script:
```bash
D:\Projects\Unified-AI-Project\apps\backend\run_test_fixes.bat
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the following test failures should be resolved:
- `TestLightweightCodeModel::test_get_tool_structure_direct_valid_path`
- `TestLightweightCodeModel::test_get_tool_structure_prefers_exact_over_pattern`
- `TestLightweightCodeModel::test_get_tool_structure_resolve_exact_name_dot_py`
- `TestLightweightCodeModel::test_get_tool_structure_resolve_suffix_tool_pattern`
- `TestLightweightCodeModel::test_get_tool_structure_resolve_tool_prefix_pattern`
- `TestAlphaDeepModel::test_learning_mechanism`
- `test_get_simple_response_standard_flow`
- `test_get_simple_response_tool_dispatch_success`
- `test_get_simple_response_tool_dispatch_error`
- `test_handle_project_happy_path`

If any tests still fail, please check the specific error messages and compare with the fixes documented above.
