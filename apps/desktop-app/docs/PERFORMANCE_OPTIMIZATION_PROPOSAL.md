# Performance Optimization Proposal

This document proposes a strategy for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in the Electron application.

## 1. The Problem

As the application grows in complexity, it is important to ensure that it remains performant and responsive. We currently do not have a strategy for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

## 2. The Proposal: Chrome DevTools Profiler

I propose using the Chrome DevTools profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the application. The profiler is a powerful tool that can help us to understand how the application is using CPU and memory resources.

### 2.1. How to Use the Profiler

1.  Open the Chrome DevTools in the Electron application by uncommenting `mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.js`.
2.  Go to the "Performance" tab in the DevTools.
3.  Click the "Record" button to start profiling.
4.  Interact with the application to reproduce the performance issue.
5.  Click the "Stop" button to stop profiling.
6.  Analyze the results to identify the performance bottleneck.

### 2.2. What to Look For

When analyzing the results of the profiler, we should look for:
-   **Long-running tasks**: Tasks that are taking a long time to complete.
-   **High CPU usage**: Functions that are using a lot of CPU resources.
-   **Memory leaks**: Objects that are not being garbage collected properly.

## 3. Benefits of this Approach

*   **Data-Driven Optimization**: We will be able to make data-driven decisions about where to focus our optimization efforts.
*   **Improved User Experience**: The application will be more performant and responsive.
*   **Maintainable Code**: The code will be easier to maintain and debug.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  Use the Chrome DevTools profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
2.  Create a report of the identified bottlenecks.
3.  Prioritize the bottlenecks based on their impact on the user experience.
4.  Refactor the code to address the identified bottlenecks.
