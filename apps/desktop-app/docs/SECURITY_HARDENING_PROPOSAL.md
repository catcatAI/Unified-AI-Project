# Security Hardening Proposal

This document proposes a strategy for hardening the security of the Electron application.

## 1. The Problem

Electron applications can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks if they are not properly secured. We currently do not have a comprehensive security strategy for our application.

## 2. The Proposal: Security Best Practices

I propose implementing a number of security best practices for Electron applications.

### 2.1. Disable `nodeIntegration`

We have already disabled `nodeIntegration` in our `main.js` file. This is a critical security best practice that prevents the renderer process from accessing Node.js APIs.

### 2.2. Enable `contextIsolation`

We have already enabled `contextIsolation` in our `main.js` file. This is another critical security best practice that prevents the renderer process from accessing the main process's globals.

### 2.3. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. We can use a CSP to specify which resources are allowed to be loaded by the application.

I propose adding the following CSP to our `index.html` file:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';">
```

This CSP will only allow resources to be loaded from the application's own origin.

### 2.4. Sanitize User Input

We should sanitize all user input to prevent XSS attacks. We can use a library like `dompurify` to do this.

### 2.5. Use `ses.enable()`

We can use the `ses` library to enable a secure, sandboxed environment for our renderer process. This will help to prevent a variety of attacks.

## 3. Benefits of this Approach

*   **Improved Security**: The application will be more secure and less vulnerable to attack.
*   **Reduced Risk**: We will reduce the risk of a security breach.
*   **Peace of Mind**: We will have peace of mind knowing that our application is secure.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  Add a Content Security Policy to `index.html`.
2.  Install the `dompurify` library and use it to sanitize user input.
3.  Install the `ses` library and use it to enable a secure, sandboxed environment.
4.  Refactor the code to implement the security best practices.
