# Electron App Enhancement Plan

This document outlines a prioritized plan for improving the Electron desktop application. The tasks are organized by category and priority.

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (High Priority) - COMPLETE

These tasks address the core structure, stability, and developer experience of the application.

*   **Task 1.1: Codebase Refactoring & Modernization - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Refactor the existing JavaScript codebase to use modern ES6+ syntax (e.g., `async/await`, classes, modules). This will improve readability and maintainability.
    *   **Logic**: This is a prerequisite for most other improvements. A clean codebase is easier and safer to modify.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `main.js`, `renderer.js`, and other scripts in `electron_app/`.

*   **Task 1.2: Centralize State Management - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Implement a state management library (like Redux or a simpler alternative like Zustand) to handle application state. This will make state changes more predictable and easier to debug.
    *   **Logic**: Centralized state is crucial for managing the complexity of a growing application. It prevents state from being scattered across different components.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `renderer.js` and UI components.

*   **Task 1.3: Improve IPC Communication - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Refactor the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between the main and renderer processes to use a more robust and structured approach. Define clear channels and data formats.
    *   **Logic**: A well-defined IPC layer is essential for security and stability. It prevents race conditions and makes the communication between the frontend and backend parts of the app more reliable.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`.

## Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements (Medium Priority) - COMPLETE

These tasks focus on improving the user experience and visual design of the application.

*   **Task 2.1: UI Component Library - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Adopt a UI component library (like a simple set of custom components or a lightweight library) to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
    *   **Logic**: A consistent UI is more professional and easier for users to navigate.
    *   **Files to Touch**: UI-related files in `electron_app/views/` and `electron_app/src/`.

*   **Task 2.2: Responsive Layout - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Make the application layout responsive, so it adapts gracefully to different window sizes.
    *   **Logic**: A responsive layout improves usability and makes the application feel more modern.
    *   **Files to Touch**: CSS files and view templates.

*   **Task 2.3: User Feedback and Notifications - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Implement a system for providing clear feedback to the user, such as loading indicators, success messages, and error notifications.
    *   **Logic**: Good user feedback is essential for a positive user experience. It keeps the user informed about what the application is doing.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `renderer.js` and UI components.

## Phase 3: New Features (Medium to Low Priority) - COMPLETE

These tasks involve adding new functionality to the application.

*   **Task 3.1: Application Settings Page - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Create a settings page where users can configure application preferences (e.g., theme, default model, notification settings).
    *   **Logic**: A settings page gives users more control over their experience.
    *   **Files to Touch**: New view and renderer files for the settings page.

*   **Task 3.2: History and Session Management - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Implement a system for saving and restoring user sessions and conversation history.
    *   **Logic**: This is a core feature for any chat-based application.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `main.js`, `renderer.js`, and potentially a new data storage mechanism.

## Phase 4: Performance and Security (Low Priority for now) - COMPLETE

These tasks address performance optimization and security hardening.

*   **Task 4.1: Performance Optimization - SKIPPED**
    *   **Description**: Profile the application to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Logic**: A performant application is more enjoyable to use.
    *   **Files to Touch**: Potentially any part of the codebase.
    *   **Reason for Skipping**: Unable to run the application and use the profiler.

*   **Task 4.2: Security Hardening - COMPLETE**
    *   **Description**: Review the application for potential security vulnerabilities and implement security best practices for Electron apps.
    *   **Logic**: Security is important, especially for a desktop application that has access to the user's system.
    *   **Files to Touch**: `main.js`, `preload.js`, and HTML files.
