# Responsive Layout Proposal

This document proposes a plan for making the Electron application's layout responsive using modern CSS techniques.

## 1. The Problem

The current layout is fixed-width and does not adapt to different window sizes. This can result in a poor user experience on smaller screens or when the window is resized.

## 2. The Proposal: Flexbox and Media Queries

I propose using a combination of CSS Flexbox and Media Queries to create a flexible and responsive layout.

### 2.1. Flexbox for Layout

We will use Flexbox to create a flexible layout that can adapt to different screen sizes. The main layout will be a single column on small screens, and will switch to a two-column layout on larger screens.

### 2.2. Media Queries for Breakpoints

We will use media queries to define breakpoints at which the layout will change. For example, we can define a breakpoint at 768px to switch from a single-column layout to a two-column layout.

### 2.3. Example CSS

Here is an example of how we can use Flexbox and Media Queries to create a responsive layout:

```css
/* Base styles for mobile-first layout */
#mainContent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Styles for larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  #mainContent {
    flex-direction: row;
  }

  #chatView {
    flex: 2;
  }

  #hspServicesView {
    flex: 1;
  }
}
```

## 3. Benefits of this Approach

*   **Improved User Experience**: The application will look good and be easy to use on a wide range of screen sizes.
*   **Modern CSS**: This approach uses modern CSS techniques that are well-supported by modern browsers.
*   **Maintainable Code**: The CSS will be organized and easy to maintain.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  Move the existing CSS from the `<style>` block in `index.html` to a new `style.css` file.
2.  Refactor the CSS to use Flexbox for layout.
3.  Add media queries to create a responsive layout.
4.  Update `index.html` to link to the new `style.css` file.
