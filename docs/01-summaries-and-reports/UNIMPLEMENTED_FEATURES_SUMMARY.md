# Unimplemented / Partially Implemented Core Features Summary

This document provides a consolidated list of core features within the Unified-AI-Project that are either entirely unimplemented or are only partially implemented/conceptual, based on a recent review of the codebase and documentation.

## Overview

The Unified-AI-Project aims for a sophisticated AI ecosystem. While significant progress has been made on foundational infrastructure, several key components and advanced functionalities are still in early stages of development or remain as conceptual designs.

## List of Features and Their Implementation Status

### 1. Core Application Features

*   **Desktop Pet (桌面寵物精靈)**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented
    *   **Description:** The initial MVP application for testing and evolving AGI concepts.
    *   **Notes:** A core application layer feature.

*   **Economic System (經濟系統)**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented
    *   **Description:** System for managing virtual currency and transactions within the AI ecosystem.
    *   **Notes:** A core application layer feature.

### 2. Advanced AI / AGI Components

*   **Linguistic Immune System (LIS)**
    *   **Status:** Largely Conceptual with Foundational, but Incomplete, Implementations
    *   **Description:** A multi-faceted system for detecting, recovering from, and learning from semantic errors in AI's linguistic output and input.
    *   **Sub-components Status:**
        *   `ERR-INTROSPECTOR`: Conceptual (sensor for semantic anomalies)
        *   `ECHO-SHIELD`: Conceptual (prevents semantic stagnation/repetition)
        *   `SYNTAX-INFLAMMATION DETECTOR`: Conceptual (identifies unstable linguistic patterns)
        *   `IMMUNO-NARRATIVE CACHE`: Partially Implemented (`HAMLISCache` exists with basic storage/retrieval, but complex queries/logic are conceptual)
        *   `TONAL REPAIR ENGINE`: Basic Implementation (very simplistic repair logic, advanced repair is conceptual)

*   **Deep Mapping (作為智能抽象/標記化過程)**
    *   **Status:** Conceptual
    *   **Description:** An advanced data transformation process to convert complex AI states into highly compact, symbolic representations for resource optimization.
    *   **Notes:** The `DeepMapper` utility exists, but it's a generic tool; the intelligent engine for creating these deep mappings is conceptual.

*   **Personality Simulation (動態、深度映射的狀態管理)**
    *   **Status:** Conceptual
    *   **Description:** The AI's ability to exhibit consistent, nuanced, and context-aware personas, dynamically adjusting responses based on emotional state, context, and learned preferences.
    *   **Notes:** The `PersonalityManager` component is implemented for loading and managing static personality profiles, but the dynamic simulation based on deeply mapped states is conceptual.

*   **Knowledge Graph (知識圖譜)**
    *   **Status:** Largely Unimplemented
    *   **Description:** A system for representing and managing AI's knowledge in a graph structure.
    *   **Notes:** Only data structures (`types.py`) are defined; the core functionality to build, query, and manage the graph is missing.

*   **Meta Formulas (元公式)**
    *   **Status:** Conceptual and Largely Unimplemented
    *   **Description:** A system for defining and executing meta-level rules or formulas that govern AI behavior and learning.
    *   **Notes:** Existing files provide only basic class definitions and placeholders (`MetaFormula` base class, `ErrX`, `UndefinedField`).

*   **Alpha Deep Model Design (Alpha Deep 模型設計)**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented
    *   **Description:** A model for high-compression of structured AI state objects and a placeholder for a learning mechanism.
    *   **Notes:** Data structures and compression/decompression are functional, but the core "deep learning" or adaptive mechanism is a placeholder.

*   **Fragmenta Orchestrator (Fragmenta 編排器)**
    *   **Status:** Minimally Implemented Placeholder
    *   **Description:** Designed to process complex tasks by orchestrating retrieval and processing of multiple candidate memories.
    *   **Notes:** The current implementation is a basic placeholder lacking sophisticated orchestration logic.

*   **Simultaneous Translation (即時翻譯)**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented (Mock/Placeholder)
    *   **Description:** Module for real-time translation of linguistic input/output.
    *   **Notes:** The current implementation is a mock that simply echoes text; actual translation functionality is missing.

*   **Audio Processing (音頻處理)**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented (Placeholder)
    *   **Description:** Module for processing audio data.
    *   **Notes:** Currently a simple placeholder class.

### 3. Service & Integration Components

*   **JS Tool Dispatcher**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented in Python Backend
    *   **Description:** Component for dispatching tools implemented in JavaScript.
    *   **Notes:** Would reside in the JS frontend or desktop application, not the Python backend.

*   **Node.js Services**
    *   **Status:** Unimplemented (Future Microservice Placeholder)
    *   **Description:** Placeholder for future microservices implemented in Node.js.
    *   **Notes:** Explicitly marked as a future component.

*   **AI Virtual Input System (AVIS)**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented
    *   **Description:** Provides a simulated environment for the AI to interact with GUIs.
    *   **Notes:** The simulation part is functional, but the ability to control real-world input devices is unimplemented.
