# Frontend vs. Backend Comparison

This document provides a detailed comparison of the `frontend-dashboard` and `backend` projects, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses.

## Frontend Dashboard (`frontend-dashboard`)

### Strengths

*   **Modern Tech Stack**: It uses a modern tech stack, including Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: It uses a component-based architecture with a dedicated UI component library.
*   **Good Data Fetching**: It has a good setup for data fetching, with `axios` and `@tanstack/react-query`.
*   **Testing Framework**: It has a testing framework in place.

### Weaknesses

*   **"Quest Features"**: The `src/quest-features` directory is a standalone React application that is not integrated with Next.js.
*   **Dependency Bloat**: There are a lot of dependencies.
*   **Lax ESLint Configuration**: The ESLint configuration is very lax, with a large number of important rules disabled. This can lead to inconsistent code style and potential errors.
*   **Test Coverage**: The test coverage needs to be assessed.

## Backend (`backend`)

### Strengths

*   **Well-Organized Project Structure**: The code is organized into a `src` directory, which is a good practice.
*   **Highly Configurable**: The `configs` directory contains a large number of YAML and JSON configuration files.
*   **Extensive Test Suite**: The `tests` directory is extensive and seems to cover a wide range of the application's functionality.
*   **Modern Tech Stack**: It uses a modern tech stack for a Python application.

### Weaknesses

*   **Dependency Management**: It uses a `requirements.txt` file for dependency management, which is not as robust as using a tool like Poetry or Pipenv.
*   **Code Style**: The code style and linting rules need to be checked for consistency.
