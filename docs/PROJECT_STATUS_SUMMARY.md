# Unified-AI-Project: Status Summary

**Last Updated:** October 2023 (based on automated review)

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level summary of the implementation status of various components and features within the Unified-AI-Project. It aims to distinguish between:
*   Implemented functionalities.
*   Explicitly documented TODO items requiring code changes.
*   Broader conceptual goals or areas identified for further development.

This summary is based on automated code and documentation review.

## 1. Core AI / Dialogue Management (`src/core_ai/dialogue/`)

*   **Implemented:**
    *   `DialogueManager` class structure exists, handling conversation flow.
    *   Integration with `PersonalityManager`, `HAMMemoryManager`, `LLMInterface`, `EmotionSystem`, `CrisisSystem`, `TimeSystem`, `FormulaEngine`, `ToolDispatcher`, and basic learning components.
    *   Session management (start, active sessions history).
    *   Basic crisis detection and response.
    *   Formula matching and execution (including tool dispatch and initiating tool drafting).
    *   LLM fallback for responses.
    *   Rudimentary Knowledge Graph (KG) query capability based on `ContentAnalyzerModule` output for the current session.
    *   Integration points for HSP (task dispatch, result handling).
*   **Pending (Explicit TODOs):**
    *   None directly in `DialogueManager.py` from `TODO_PLACEHOLDERS.md`, but relies on other modules with TODOs.
*   **Further Development / Conceptual Goals:**
    *   More sophisticated integration with `ContentAnalyzerModule`'s KG for richer contextual awareness beyond simple Q&A (as per `README.md`).
    *   Refined handling of HSP task results and proactive information integration.
    *   More advanced dialogue strategies.

## 2. Memory System (HAM - `src/core_ai/memory/`)

*   **Implemented:**
    *   `HAMMemoryManager` class providing core storage functionality.
    *   Storage of experiences with metadata.
    *   Text abstraction for "dialogue_text" types (summary, keywords, placeholders for radicals/POS).
    *   Data integrity features: SHA256 checksums.
    *   Data transformation: zlib compression and Fernet encryption (key via `MIKO_HAM_KEY` env var).
    *   Persistence to a JSON file (`core_storage_filename`).
    *   Basic recall of abstracted "gists" and querying capabilities (keywords in metadata, data type, date range).
*   **Pending (Explicit TODOs):**
    *   None directly in `HAMMemoryManager.py` from `TODO_PLACEHOLDERS.md`.
*   **Further Development / Conceptual Goals:**
    *   **Advanced Deep Mapping (Conceptual):** The idea of mapping complex states to highly compact/symbolic tokens (beyond current abstraction/compression) was discussed (`DEEP_MAPPING_AND_PERSONALITY_SIMULATION.md`) but is not currently implemented. The "XXX" strings in data files were found to be coincidental substrings, not such tokens.
    *   More sophisticated query capabilities (e.g., searching encrypted content if feasible, semantic search).
    *   Refined abstraction for various data types beyond text.
    *   Strategies for memory consolidation, forgetting, or archiving.

## 3. Learning System (`src/core_ai/learning/`)

*   **Implemented:**
    *   `LearningManager` to coordinate learning processes.
    *   `FactExtractorModule` for extracting structured facts from dialogue via LLM.
    *   `SelfCritiqueModule` for evaluating AI responses.
    *   `ContentAnalyzerModule` (Phase 2 prototype) using spaCy and NetworkX for NER, basic relationship extraction, and generating a session-level knowledge graph.
    *   Storage of learned facts and HSP-derived facts into HAM, including confidence scores and conflict resolution logic for HSP facts (Type 1 ID-based, Type 2 Semantic including numerical merge).
    *   Modulation of HSP fact confidence by sender trust score.
*   **Pending (Explicit TODOs):**
    *   None directly in these modules from `TODO_PLACEHOLDERS.md`.
*   **Further Development / Conceptual Goals:**
    *   **Content Analyzer Module (`README.md`):**
        *   Refine extraction techniques.
        *   Deeper integration of its knowledge graph into `DialogueManager` for richer contextual awareness.
    *   More sophisticated learning from self-critique.
    *   Broader application of the `ContentAnalyzerModule`'s KG.

## 4. Fragmenta Orchestration (`src/fragmenta/`)

*   **Implemented:**

    *   Rudimentary implementation of `process_complex_task` including:
        *   Basic input analysis (type, size).
        *   Simplified strategy determination (chunking for text > threshold, direct LLM, or tool call).
        *   Simple text chunking (`_chunk_data`).
        *   Dispatch of chunks to LLM or a specified tool (`_dispatch_chunk_to_processing`).
        *   Storage of chunk results in HAM (returns memory ID).
        *   Basic merging of results by recalling from HAM and joining strings.
*   **Pending (Explicit TODOs):**
    *   None directly in `FragmentaOrchestrator.py` from `TODO_PLACEHOLDERS.md`.
*   **Further Development / Conceptual Goals (from `Fragmenta_design_spec.md`):**
    *   Full implementation of most features in the design spec is pending. This includes:
        *   Sophisticated task analysis and strategy selection.
        *   Advanced data pre-processing (semantic chunking, diverse file types).
        *   Robust sub-task orchestration, dependency management, potential parallelism.
        *   Advanced result synthesis and post-processing methods.
        *   Self-evaluation and meta-learning hooks.

        *   Multimodal data handling.
        *   Hardware awareness and adaptive behavior.
