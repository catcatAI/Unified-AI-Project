## Document Index

1.  **[AGI Development Plan](./agi-development-plan.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The high-level strategic roadmap. It defines the phased approach to reaching L4/L5 AGI, focusing on the development of key capabilities like the Persistent Cognitive Loop, autonomous learning, and distributed collaboration.

2.  **[Architecture Deep Dive](./architecture-deep-dive.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A detailed explanation of the project's unique and advanced architecture. This is the best place to understand the core concepts of the "Data Life," HSP, Deep Mapping, UID/Key security model, and the hot-update/hot-migration framework.

3.  **[Project Status Assessment](./project-status-assessment.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A comprehensive evaluation of the project's current state, including its AGI level (L3), core architectural strengths, and the key limitations or gaps that need to be addressed to reach the next level.

4.  **[Technical Implementation Roadmap](./technical-implementation-roadmap.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The ground-level, code-focused task list. This document breaks down the high-level goals from the AGI Development Plan into concrete, actionable technical tasks for developers.
