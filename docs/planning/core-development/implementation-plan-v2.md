# Implementation Plan v2 - Project Status and Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## 1. Current Project Status

Based on a thorough analysis of the codebase, it has been determined that the project is in an early stage of development. While the overall architecture is well-defined, a significant number of core features are either unimplemented or exist only as placeholders.

There is a major discrepancy between the existing `technical-implementation-roadmap.md` (last updated Jan 2025), which marks all tasks as complete, and the actual state of the code. This document supersedes the old roadmap and provides a realistic plan for moving forward.

## 2. Prioritized List of Unimplemented Features

The following is a prioritized list of the most critical unimplemented features, based on their importance to the core functionality of the AI system.

### Phase 1: Core AI Foundation

This phase focuses on implementing the absolute essential components for the AI to have a basic level of memory, control, and reasoning.

*   **Vector Store (`src/core/memory/vector_store.py`):** The interface to the vector database is completely missing. This is the highest priority as it is fundamental for semantic memory.
*   **LIS Cache Interface (`src/core_ai/lis/lis_cache_interface.py`):** The Long-term Incubation System cache is unimplemented. This is critical for long-term memory management.
*   **Unified Control Center (`src/core_ai/integration/unified_control_center.py`):** The central AI orchestrator is a placeholder. It needs to be implemented to coordinate other services.
*   **Causal Reasoning Engine (`src/core_ai/reasoning/causal_reasoning_engine.py`):** The reasoning engine is a skeleton. A basic implementation is needed for the AI to perform logical reasoning.
*   **World Model Simulator (`src/core_ai/world_model/environment_simulator.py`):** The world model is a skeleton. A basic implementation is needed for the AI to understand its environment.

### Phase 2: Advanced AI Capabilities

This phase builds on the foundation and adds more advanced AI capabilities.

*   **HAM Memory Manager (`src/core_ai/memory/ham_memory_manager.py`):** Implement the placeholder features for "deep mapping" (radicals, POS tags).
*   **Distributed Processing (`src/core_ai/optimization/distributed_processing.py`):** Implement the framework for distributed processing.
*   **Audio/Vision Services (`src/services/audio_service.py`, `src/services/vision_service.py`):** Implement the full functionality of these services.
*   **Image Generation Tool (`src/tools/image_generation_tool.py`):** Replace the placeholder URL with a real image generation service.

### Phase 3: Game Logic and Other Modules

This phase focuses on the game logic and other supporting modules.

*   **Game Logic (`src/game/`):** Implement the core game logic, including player actions, NPCs, and scenes.
*   **Other unimplemented modules:** Address the remaining unimplemented modules, such as the crisis system, emotion system, etc.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next step is to begin with Phase 1, starting with the implementation of the **Vector Store**.

This plan will be updated as features are implemented.
