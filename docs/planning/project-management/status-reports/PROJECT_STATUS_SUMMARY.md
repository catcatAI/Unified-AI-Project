# Project Status Summary

This document provides a summary of the current status of the Unified AI Project, highlighting both completed and incomplete components. This analysis is based on a review of the codebase, existing documentation, and code comments.

## 1. Architectural Notes

The system is a multi-agent AI project with a distributed, service-oriented architecture. Key components include:
- **HSP (Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol)**: An MQTT-based communication backbone for all components.
- **HAM (Hierarchical Abstractive Memory)**: A sophisticated, layered memory architecture.
- **Multi-LLM Service**: A dedicated service for interacting with multiple LLM providers.
- **Core Services Hub**: A central script (`src/core_services.py`) for initializing and managing core components.

## 未完成 (Unfinished)

## 已完成 (Completed)

*   **增量學習系統 (Incremental Learning System)**:
    *   **描述**: 已實現經驗重放機制和知識蒸餾框架，為系統的持續學習奠定基礎。
    *   **狀態**: 已完成。

*   **自我評估系統 (Self-Evaluation System)**:
    *   **描述**: 已實現任務執行評估器，能夠評估任務執行效果並生成改進建議。
    *   **狀態**: 已完成。

## 已完成 (Completed)

*   **Comprehensive Health Check**:
    *   **File**: `scripts/health_check.py`
    *   **Description**: The health check script is a standalone utility for verifying the status of the system's core components. It checks the API server, Firebase credentials, MQTT broker, and Firestore database. The script was also updated to be portable by removing a hardcoded path.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

These components are implemented and functioning as expected, or have been investigated and clarified.

*   **HSP Schema URIs**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/src/hsp/connector.py`
    *   **Description**: The `payload_schema_uri` field in outgoing HSP messages is now dynamically generated. A `get_schema_uri` helper function has been implemented in the `HSPConnector` module. This function constructs a proper `file:///` URI based on the project's file structure, pointing to the correct schema in the `apps/backend/schemas/` directory. This resolves the previous issue of using hardcoded placeholder strings.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

*   **Core Feature Implementations**: Several key TODOs outlined in `docs/06-project-management/planning/todo-placeholders.md` have been addressed.

*   **Data Anomaly Clarification**: The presence of `"XXX"` substrings in `data/processed_data/dialogue_context_memory.json` has been investigated and clarified.

*   **Minor Code Quality Fixes**:
    *   Removed a duplicated `OverwriteDecision` enum in `apps/backend/src/shared/types/common_types.py`.
    *   Refactored the Electron app's `main.js` and `renderer.js` to use modern ES6+ syntax.

*   **Electron App Enhancements**:
    *   **State Management**: Implemented a centralized state management system.
    *   **IPC Communication**: Refactored the IPC communication to be more structured and maintainable.
    *   **UI Component Library**: Created a simple UI component library and refactored the UI to use it.
    *   **Responsive Layout**: Implemented a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   **User Feedback**: Implemented a user feedback and notification system.
    *   **History and Session Management**: Implemented a system for saving and restoring user sessions and conversation history.
    *   **Security Hardening**: Implemented several security best practices for Electron applications.

## 已失效 (Invalid / By Design)

These items are not pending tasks but are either intentional design choices or no longer relevant.

*   **Configuration Placeholders**:
    *   **File**: `apps/backend/configs/api_keys.yaml`
    *   **Description**: This file contains placeholder values for various API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`). This is **intentional** for security reasons. The system is designed to load actual keys from environment variables at runtime.
