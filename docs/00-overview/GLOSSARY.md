# Glossary

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Unified AI Project.

## A

### AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
Intelligent agents that understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. In this project, we aim for Level 3-4 AGI capabilities.

### Alpha Deep Model
A concept model that represents advanced deep learning capabilities for complex pattern recognition and decision making.

## C

### Closed-Loop Architecture
A system design where outputs are fed back as inputs to influence future behavior, enabling continuous learning and adaptation.

### Concept Models
Abstract representations of complex ideas or systems that guide AI behavior and decision-making processes.

## D

### Data Life
The philosophy that data should be treated as a living entity that can grow, evolve, and interact with its environment.

## E

### Environment Simulator
A concept model that creates virtual environments for AI training and testing.

## H

### HAM (Hierarchical Abstract Memory)
A memory system that organizes information in a hierarchical structure for efficient storage and retrieval.

### HSP (Heterogeneous Service Protocol)
A high-speed synchronization protocol that enables collaboration between different AI services and modules.

## L

### Layered Architecture
A system design that separates functionality into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities.

## M

### Multi-Modal AI
AI systems that can process and understand multiple types of data (text, audio, images) simultaneously.

## R

### Rovo Dev Agents
Atlassian's AI agents that can be integrated with the Unified AI Project for enhanced functionality.

## S

### Semantic-Level Security
Security mechanisms that protect data based on its meaning and context rather than just its format or location.

## U

### Unified Representation
The approach of mapping different types of data to a common symbolic space to reduce processing complexity.

## V

### VectorStore
A database system that stores and retrieves information using vector embeddings for semantic search.
