# Project Charter

## Project Name
Unified AI Project

## Project Vision
To create a hybrid AI ecosystem that can evolve towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Level 3-4 through a closed-loop learning architecture, designed with the philosophy of "Data Life" to enable true autonomous learning and evolution.

## Project Mission
To develop a scalable, efficient, and secure AI platform that demonstrates advanced autonomous learning capabilities while remaining accessible on low-resource computing environments.

## Objectives
1. **Technical Objective**: Implement a complete AI architecture with HAM memory system and HSP protocol
2. **Functional Objective**: Create a multi-modal AI agent system with creative writing, image generation, and web search capabilities
3. **Research Objective**: Develop and validate concept models including Environment Simulator, Causal Reasoning Engine, Adaptive Learning Controller, and Alpha Deep Model
4. **Deployment Objective**: Optimize the system for low-resource deployment while maintaining high-level AI capabilities
5. **Community Objective**: Foster an open-source community around the project to accelerate development and adoption
