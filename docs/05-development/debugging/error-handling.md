# Error Handling

## Overview

The `error.py` (`src/shared/error.py`) module provides a centralized and standardized approach to error handling within the Unified-AI-Project. It defines a custom exception type, `ProjectError`, and a global error handler function, `project_error_handler`, to ensure consistent logging, reporting, and management of errors across the entire system.

This module is crucial for maintaining the stability and debuggability of the AI system, allowing developers to quickly identify, diagnose, and address issues.

## Key Components

1.  **`ProjectError` Exception Class**: 
    *   A custom exception class that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.
    *   It allows for the encapsulation of an error `message` and a numerical `code` (similar to HTTP status codes, defaulting to 500 for internal server errors).
    *   Provides a clear and consistent way to raise application-specific errors throughout the codebase.

2.  **`project_error_handler(error: ProjectError)` Function**: 
    *   A central function designed to process instances of `ProjectError`.
    *   In its current form, it prints the error message to the console.
    *   **Future Enhancements**: In a production environment, this handler would be extended to integrate with:
        *   **Logging Systems**: To record detailed error information (stack traces, context) for post-mortem analysis.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting Tools**: To trigger alerts for critical errors, notifying development or operations teams.
        *   **Metrics Systems**: To track error rates and types over time.
        *   **User Feedback Mechanisms**: To provide graceful error messages to end-users without exposing sensitive internal details.

## How it Works

When an unexpected or unrecoverable situation occurs within the Unified-AI-Project, a `ProjectError` is raised with a descriptive message and an appropriate error code. This exception can then be caught by higher-level logic, and the `project_error_handler` function can be invoked to perform centralized error processing. This pattern ensures that all errors are handled consistently, regardless of where they originate in the application.

## Integration and Importance

-   **System Stability**: By providing a structured way to handle errors, the module contributes to the overall stability and reliability of the AI system.
-   **Debugging and Diagnostics**: Centralized error logging (via the handler) makes it significantly easier to debug issues and understand the root cause of failures.
-   **Maintainability**: Promotes a consistent error-handling pattern across the codebase, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
-   **Operational Visibility**: When integrated with monitoring tools, it provides real-time insights into the health and performance of the AI system.
