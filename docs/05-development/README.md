# Development Guidelines

This section provides information on debugging, testing, and development workflows for the Unified AI Project.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
2. **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
3. **pnpm** (package manager)
4. **Git** (version control system)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd unified-ai-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `apps/backend` directory with the necessary configuration variables.

## Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure with the following key directories:

- `apps/`: Contains the main applications
  - `backend/`: Python backend services
  - `frontend-dashboard/`: Web-based dashboard
  - `desktop-app/`: Electron-based desktop application
- `packages/`: Shared packages and libraries
  - `cli/`: Command-line interface tools
  - `ui/`: Shared UI components
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development and deployment
- `tools/`: Development tools and utilities

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development Servers

To start both the backend and frontend development servers concurrently:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Alternatively, you can use the unified management script:

1. Double-click `unified-ai.bat`
2. Select "Start Development"
3. Choose "Start Full Development Environment"

### Code Organization

The project follows these organizational principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each component should have a single responsibility and be loosely coupled with others.
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions across all files and directories.
3. **Clear Documentation**: Each module should include clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

### Branching Strategy

The project uses a GitFlow branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Latest development code
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new functionality
- `bugfix/*`: Branches for bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

## Testing

### Test Structure

The project includes multiple types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under load

### Running Tests

To run all tests across the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run tests with coverage reports:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

To run specific test suites:

```bash
# Backend tests
cd apps/backend
python -m pytest tests/

# Frontend tests
cd apps/frontend-dashboard
pnpm test

# Desktop app tests
cd apps/desktop-app
pnpm test
```

### Writing Tests

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested.
2. **Follow AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure for test cases.
3. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be able to run independently.
4. **Use Appropriate Assertions**: Choose the right assertion methods for the data types being tested.

## Debugging

### Backend Debugging

For debugging Python backend services:

1. **Logging**: Use the built-in logging system to trace execution flow.
2. **Debug Scripts**: Use the provided debug scripts in the `apps/backend` directory.
3. **IDE Debugging**: Configure your IDE to attach to the running Python processes.

### Frontend Debugging

For debugging the web-based dashboard:

1. **Browser Developer Tools**: Use the browser's built-in developer tools.
2. **React DevTools**: Install React Developer Tools for React-specific debugging.
3. **Console Logging**: Use console.log statements for quick debugging.

### Desktop App Debugging

For debugging the Electron-based desktop application:

1. **Electron DevTools**: Use Electron's built-in developer tools.
2. **Main Process Debugging**: Configure your IDE to debug the main Electron process.
3. **Renderer Process Debugging**: Debug the renderer process like a regular web application.

## Code Quality

### Linting

The project uses linting tools to ensure code quality:

- **Python**: Flake8 and Black for code formatting and style checking
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint for code quality and formatting
- **Markdown**: Markdownlint for documentation formatting

To run linting checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Code Review Process

All code changes must go through a code review process:

1. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit changes as a pull request to the `develop` branch.
2. **Automated Checks**: Wait for automated tests and linting checks to pass.
3. **Peer Review**: Request review from at least one other team member.
4. **Address Feedback**: Make requested changes and resubmit for review.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the pull request.

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes, update the documentation:

1. **API Documentation**: Update API endpoint documentation in `docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md`.
2. **User Guides**: Update user guides in the `docs/` directory.
3. **Technical Documentation**: Update technical documentation in the appropriate sections.

### Documentation Style

Follow these guidelines for documentation:

1. **Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary complexity.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent markdown formatting throughout.
3. **Examples**: Include practical examples where appropriate.
4. **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation sections.

## Deployment

### Building for Production

To build the project for production deployment:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will build all applications and packages for production use.

### Deployment Process

The deployment process includes:

1. **Build**: Compile all applications and packages.
2. **Test**: Run production tests to ensure stability.
3. **Package**: Create deployment packages for each application.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy packages to the target environment.

### Environment Configuration

Different environments require different configuration:

- **Development**: Use `.env.development` for development-specific settings.
- **Staging**: Use `.env.staging` for staging environment settings.
- **Production**: Use `.env.production` for production settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependency Installation Failures**: Ensure all prerequisites are installed and try clearing package manager caches.
2. **Port Conflicts**: Check if required ports are already in use by other applications.
3. **Environment Variable Issues**: Verify that all required environment variables are set correctly.
4. **Database Connection Problems**: Check database credentials and network connectivity.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues that you cannot resolve:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Search the project's issue tracker for similar problems.
2. **Review Documentation**: Ensure you have followed all setup and usage instructions.
3. **Ask for Help**: Create a new issue with detailed information about the problem.
