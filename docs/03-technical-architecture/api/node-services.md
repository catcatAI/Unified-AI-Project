# Node.js Services: Placeholder for Future Microservices

## Overview

The `node_services` directory (`apps/backend/src/services/node_services/`) serves as a **placeholder for future Node.js backend services** within the Unified-AI-Project. While currently containing a basic Express.js server with example routes, it signifies the project's intention to incorporate JavaScript-based microservices for specific functionalities.

This module is designed to be an extensible point for services that might benefit from Node.js's asynchronous, event-driven architecture, such as real-time communication, high-throughput API gateways, or specialized data processing.

## Current Status and Purpose

Currently, `server.js` provides a minimal Express.js application that:

-   Listens on a configurable port (default: `3000`).
-   Exposes a root endpoint (`/`) returning a placeholder message.
-   Provides a status endpoint (`/api/node/status`) returning basic service information.
-   Includes an echo endpoint (`/api/node/echo`) for demonstrating POST request handling.

This setup acts as a scaffold, demonstrating how Node.js services would be integrated into the broader Unified-AI-Project ecosystem.

## Key Responsibilities and Features (Future)

In the future, these Node.js services could be expanded to:

1.  **Real-time Communication**: Handle WebSocket connections for real-time updates, chat functionalities, or game state synchronization.
2.  **High-Throughput API Gateways**: Act as a lightweight, fast proxy for routing requests to various backend services, potentially handling authentication and rate limiting.
3.  **Specialized Data Processing**: Perform specific data transformations, validations, or integrations that are better suited for JavaScript environments.
4.  **Integration with External JavaScript Libraries**: Leverage the vast npm ecosystem for functionalities not readily available or efficiently implemented in Python.
5.  **Microservice Architecture**: Host independent microservices that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately from the main Python backend.
6.  **Interoperability**: Interact with Python services via message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka), gRPC, or REST APIs, contributing to the hybrid AI ecosystem.

## How it Works (Current Placeholder)

The `server.js` uses the `express` library to create a simple web server. It defines routes that respond to GET and POST requests. The `package.json` specifies `server.js` as the main entry point and includes a `start` script to run the server using `node server.js`.

## Code Location

`apps/backend/src/services/node_services/`
-   `package.json`: Node.js project configuration and dependencies.
-   `server.js`: The main server application for Node.js services.
