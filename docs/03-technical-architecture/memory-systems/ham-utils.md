# HAMUtils: Hierarchical Associative Memory Utility Functions

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `ham_utils.py` module (`src/core_ai/memory/ham_utils.py`). This module is intended to provide a collection of utility functions that support various operations within the Hierarchical Associative Memory (HAM) system.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `ham_utils.py` is to encapsulate common, reusable helper functions that are essential for the functionalities of the HAM system. While currently containing placeholder implementations, these utilities are designed to provide foundational services such as vector operations for semantic search, unique identifier generation for memory entries, and time management for tracking memory recency. This centralization of utilities promotes code reusability and maintainability across HAM components.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **`calculate_cosine_similarity`**:
    *   **Current State**: A placeholder implementation that always returns `0.0`.
    *   **Intended Purpose**: To calculate the cosine similarity between two numerical vectors. This function is crucial for determining the semantic similarity between memory embeddings during retrieval operations, enabling relevant memory recall.
*   **`generate_embedding`**:
    *   **Current State**: A placeholder implementation that returns a NumPy array of zeros with a default size (e.g., 384 dimensions).
    *   **Intended Purpose**: To generate a numerical embedding (a dense vector representation) for a given text string. In a full implementation, this would typically involve integrating with an external embedding model (e.g., from a large language model or a dedicated embedding service).
*   **`get_current_utc_timestamp`**:
    *   **Current State**: A placeholder implementation that always returns `0.0`.
    *   **Intended Purpose**: To return the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timestamp as a float. This is essential for tracking the recency of memory entries, which can be a factor in memory recall and forgetting mechanisms.
*   **`is_valid_uuid`**:
    *   **Current State**: A placeholder implementation that always returns `True`.
    *   **Intended Purpose**: To check if a given string is a valid Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This utility is useful for validating the format of memory IDs and ensuring data integrity.

## How it Works

This module currently contains only placeholder functions that return dummy values or perform minimal operations. In a full implementation, these functions would integrate with external libraries (like `numpy` for vector operations, or specific NLP libraries for embeddings) or more complex algorithms to provide their intended functionalities. The design anticipates these integrations, allowing for a clear separation of concerns.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`HAMMemoryManager`**: This module would heavily rely on these utilities for various core HAM tasks, such as generating embeddings for new memories, calculating similarity scores during memory recall, and managing timestamps for memory entries.
*   **`VectorMemoryStore`**: Specifically, the `VectorMemoryStore` would utilize `calculate_cosine_similarity` for its semantic search capabilities and `generate_embedding` for converting text content into vector representations.
*   **`numpy`**: Expected to be a key dependency for numerical operations on vectors, particularly for `calculate_cosine_similarity` and `generate_embedding`.
*   **`uuid`**: Expected to be used by `is_valid_uuid` and potentially for generating new memory IDs.
