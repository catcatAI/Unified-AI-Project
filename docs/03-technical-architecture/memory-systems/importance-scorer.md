# ImportanceScorer: Memory Importance Scoring (Placeholder)

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `importance_scorer.py` module (`src/core_ai/memory/importance_scorer.py`). As of its current state, this file contains an empty `ImportanceScorer` class and serves as a placeholder.

## Purpose

The `ImportanceScorer` is intended to be a future component responsible for evaluating and assigning an importance score to memory entries within the Hierarchical Associative Memory (HAM) system. This score would be crucial for various memory management strategies, such as determining which memories to prioritize for retention, retrieval, or further processing. Its presence signifies a planned capability for intelligent memory curation.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Currently None**: As an empty class, `ImportanceScorer` currently has no functional responsibilities or features.
*   **Future Scoring Logic**: In its intended role, it would implement algorithms or models to calculate importance based on factors such as:
    *   Recency of the memory.
    *   Frequency of access or recall.
    *   Emotional salience or impact.
    *   Relevance to current goals or tasks.
    *   Connections to other important memories.
    *   User feedback or explicit importance tagging.

## How it Works

As an empty class, `ImportanceScorer` currently has no operational behavior. When implemented, it would likely provide methods that take a `HAMMemory` object (or its content/metadata) and return a numerical importance score. This score would then be used by other HAM components.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`HAMMemoryManager`**: This module would be the primary consumer of the `ImportanceScorer`. It would integrate the scoring mechanism to rank or filter memories based on their calculated importance during storage, retrieval, and maintenance operations.
*   **`HAMMemory`**: The data structure representing individual memories, which would be the input to the scoring methods.
