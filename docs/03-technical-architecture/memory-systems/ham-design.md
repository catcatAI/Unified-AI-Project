# HAM (Hierarchical Abstract Memory) Design Specification

## Overview

The Hierarchical Abstract Memory (HAM) system is a sophisticated memory management solution designed for the Unified AI Project. HAM organizes information in a hierarchical structure, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of semantic knowledge.

## Design Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Organization
HAM structures information in multiple layers:
- **Conceptual Layer**: High-level abstract concepts and relationships
- **Semantic Layer**: Meaning-based organization of information
- **Episodic Layer**: Time-based storage of experiences and events
- **Procedural Layer**: Storage of skills, procedures, and learned behaviors

### 2. Abstract Representation
Information is stored in abstract forms that capture essential features while discarding irrelevant details:
- **Feature Extraction**: Identification of key attributes and characteristics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of recurring structures and relationships
- **Generalization**: Creation of abstract concepts from specific instances

### 3. Dynamic Adaptation
HAM continuously evolves based on new experiences:
- **Incremental Learning**: Updating existing knowledge with new information
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Removing outdated or irrelevant information
- **Reorganization**: Restructuring memory hierarchies for improved efficiency

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### DeepMapper
The DeepMapper component is responsible for:
- Semantic mapping of input data to abstract representations
- Generation of data cores for efficient storage
- Identification of relationships between concepts

#### HAMMemoryManager
The HAMMemoryManager handles:
- Overall memory organization and management
- Coordination between different memory layers
- Implementation of memory policies and strategies

#### VectorStore
The VectorStore provides:
- ChromaDB-based vector database interface
- Efficient semantic search capabilities
- Storage and retrieval of vector embeddings

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: Raw data is processed and mapped to abstract representations
2. **Feature Extraction**: Key features are identified and extracted
3. **Memory Encoding**: Information is encoded into appropriate memory layers
4. **Storage**: Encoded information is stored in the VectorStore
5. **Retrieval**: Stored information is retrieved based on semantic queries
6. **Output Generation**: Retrieved information is used to generate responses or actions

## Memory Layers

### Conceptual Layer
- Stores high-level abstract concepts
- Maintains relationships between concepts
- Supports reasoning and inference operations

### Semantic Layer
- Organizes information based on meaning
- Enables semantic search and retrieval
- Supports natural language processing tasks

### Episodic Layer
- Records experiences and events over time
- Maintains temporal context and sequencing
- Supports learning from past experiences

### Procedural Layer
- Stores learned skills and procedures
- Maintains action sequences and workflows
- Supports automated task execution

## Implementation Details

### Storage Mechanisms
- **Vector Embeddings**: Information is stored as high-dimensional vectors
- **Graph Structures**: Relationships between concepts are stored as graphs
- **Temporal Indexing**: Time-based indexing for episodic memories

### Retrieval Algorithms
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search
- **Graph Traversal**: Navigation through conceptual relationships
- **Pattern Matching**: Identification of matching structures

### Memory Policies
- **Retention Policies**: Rules for keeping or discarding information
- **Update Policies**: Strategies for modifying existing memories
- **Compression Policies**: Methods for reducing memory footprint

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- **Multi-level Caching**: Different caching strategies for different memory layers
- **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used eviction for cache management
- **Prefetching**: Anticipatory loading of likely needed information

### Indexing Techniques
- **Hierarchical Indexing**: Multi-level indexes for efficient retrieval
- **Semantic Indexing**: Indexes based on meaning and context
- **Temporal Indexing**: Time-based indexes for episodic memories

### Parallel Processing
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple threads accessing memory simultaneously
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking memory operations
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of memory operations across resources

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encryption of stored information
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for memory access
- **Audit Logging**: Tracking of all memory operations

### Privacy Preservation
- **Data Anonymization**: Removal of personally identifiable information
- **Consent Management**: User control over data usage
- **Data Minimization**: Storing only necessary information

## Integration with Other Systems

### HSP Protocol
- Seamless communication with other AI services
