# HAMConfig: Hierarchical Associative Memory Configuration (Placeholder)

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `ham_config.py` module (`src/core_ai/memory/ham_config.py`). As of its current state, this file is empty and serves as a placeholder.

## Purpose

The `ham_config.py` file is intended to be the future location for configuration settings related to the Hierarchical Associative Memory (HAM) system. Its current emptiness suggests that HAM configuration is either not yet implemented, is under development, or is temporarily handled elsewhere within the project. Its presence in the directory structure indicates a planned component for HAM system customization and parameter definition.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Currently None**: As an empty file, `ham_config.py` currently has no functional responsibilities or features.
*   **Future Configuration**: In its intended role, it would define parameters for HAM, such as:
    *   Memory capacity and sizing.
    *   Persistence mechanisms (e.g., database paths, cloud storage settings).
    *   Indexing strategies (e.g., vector embedding models, similarity metrics).
    *   Retention policies and aging mechanisms.
    *   Integration points with other memory components or services.

## How it Works

As an empty file, `ham_config.py` currently has no operational behavior. When implemented, it would be loaded by the `HAMMemoryManager` or related HAM components to configure their behavior and operational parameters.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`HAMMemoryManager`**: This module would be the primary consumer of the configurations defined in `ham_config.py`. It would load these settings during its initialization to tailor its memory management strategies.
