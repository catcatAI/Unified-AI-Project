# HAMDBInterface: Hierarchical Associative Memory Database Interface (Placeholder)

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `ham_db_interface.py` module (`src/core_ai/memory/ham_db_interface.py`). As of its current state, this file is empty and serves as a placeholder.

## Purpose

The `ham_db_interface.py` file is intended to be the future location for defining the abstract interface for interacting with the underlying database used by the Hierarchical Associative Memory (HAM) system. Its current emptiness suggests that the database integration layer for HAM is either not yet implemented, is under development, or is temporarily handled elsewhere within the project. Its presence in the directory structure indicates a planned component for robust and flexible data persistence for HAM.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Currently None**: As an empty file, `ham_db_interface.py` currently has no functional responsibilities or features.
*   **Future Interface Definition**: In its intended role, it would define abstract methods for common database operations relevant to HAM, such as:
    *   Storing memory records.
    *   Retrieving memories by ID or query.
    *   Updating existing memories.
    *   Deleting memories.
    *   Handling metadata and indexing for efficient retrieval.
    *   Potentially supporting different database backends (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, vector databases).

## How it Works

As an empty file, `ham_db_interface.py` currently has no operational behavior. When implemented, it would define an `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) that `HAMMemoryManager` would depend on. Concrete implementations of this interface would then provide the actual database interaction logic for specific database technologies.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`HAMMemoryManager`**: This module would be the primary consumer of the interface defined in `ham_db_interface.py`. It would rely on this interface to perform all its persistent storage operations, abstracting away the underlying database technology.
