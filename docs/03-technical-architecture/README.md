# Technical Architecture

This section provides in-depth documentation on the system's architecture, communication protocols, memory systems, and AI components.

## System Overview

The Unified AI Project follows a monorepo architecture organized into applications and packages. The core components include:

### Applications (`apps/`)
- **`apps/desktop-app`**: The game client for "Angela's World", built with Electron.
- **`apps/backend`**: The core Python backend that powers the game's central AI character, Angela. It includes all AI models, APIs, and game logic.
- **`apps/frontend-dashboard`**: A web-based dashboard for developers to manage, monitor, and debug the AI and game systems.

### Packages (`packages/`)
- **`packages/cli`**: Command-line interface tools for interacting with the backend services.
- **`packages/ui`**: Shared UI components and design system for the frontend applications.

## Core Systems

### Heterogeneous Service Protocol (HSP)

The HSP is a high-speed synchronization protocol that enables collaboration between internal modules and external AI entities. Key features include:

- **Registration Mechanism**: New modules/AI entities joining the network
- **Reputation System**: Evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborating entities
- **Hot Updates**: Dynamic loading of new functional modules

### Hierarchical Abstract Memory (HAM) System

The HAM system is a sophisticated memory management solution that organizes information in a hierarchical structure, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of semantic knowledge. Components include:

- **DeepMapper**: Semantic mapping and data core generation
- **HAMMemoryManager**: Hierarchical semantic memory management
- **VectorStore**: ChromaDB-based vector database interface

### Multi-Modal AI Agent System

The project implements specialized AI agents for different tasks:

- **BaseAgent**: Foundation class for all specialized agents, handling HSP connections and task dispatch
- **CreativeWritingAgent**: Creative writing and content generation
- **ImageGenerationAgent**: Image generation capabilities
- **WebSearchAgent**: Web search and information retrieval

## Communication Layer

The communication layer facilitates interaction between different components of the system:

### Internal Communication
- Direct function calls within the same process
- Message queues for asynchronous communication
- Shared memory for high-performance data exchange

### External Communication
- RESTful APIs for web-based interactions
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- HSP protocol for AI-to-AI collaboration

## Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a layered data flow architecture:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives data from various sources (user input, sensors, network)
2. **Processing Layer**: Processes and analyzes the input data using AI models
3. **Memory Layer**: Stores processed information in the HAM system
4. **Decision Layer**: Makes decisions based on processed data and stored memories
5. **Action Layer**: Executes actions based on decisions
6. **Feedback Layer**: Collects feedback from actions to improve future decisions

## Security Architecture

The system implements multiple layers of security:

### Authentication
- UID/Key based authentication for all system components
- Role-based access control for different user types

### Data Protection
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Semantic-level security to protect sensitive information

### Access Control
- Fine-grained permissions for different system resources
- Audit logging for all system activities

## Performance Optimization

The system incorporates several performance optimization strategies:

### Caching
- LRU-based caching for frequently accessed data
- TTL-based cache expiration to ensure data freshness

### Parallel Processing
- AsyncIO-based concurrent execution
- Thread pools for CPU-intensive tasks

### Resource Management
- Dynamic resource allocation based on system load
- Memory optimization techniques to reduce footprint

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally:

### Vertical Scaling
- Efficient use of system resources
- Optimized algorithms to handle increased load on single nodes

### Horizontal Scaling
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
- Load balancing for distributing workload across multiple instances

## Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

### Metrics Collection
- Real-time performance metrics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Error rate monitoring

### Logging
- Structured logging for easy analysis
- Log aggregation for centralized monitoring
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Alerting
- Threshold-based alerting for critical metrics
- Anomaly detection for unusual system behavior
