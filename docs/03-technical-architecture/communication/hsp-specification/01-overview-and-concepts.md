# HSP: 1. Overview and Core Concepts

## 1.1. Introduction

### 1.1.1. Purpose

The Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol (HSP) is designed to enable
communication, data sharing, and collaborative task execution among diverse and
independently developed AI entities (HSP Participant AIs). It aims to foster a
robust, scalable, and intelligent ecosystem of interconnected AIs.

### 1.1.2. Goals

- **Interoperability:** Allow AIs with different internal architectures and
  capabilities to exchange information and services meaningfully.
- **Robustness:** Enhance overall system resilience through distributed
  knowledge, potential for consensus, and fault isolation.
- **Scalability:** Support a growing network of AIs and increasing information
  flow.
- **Collaboration:** Enable AIs to work together on complex tasks that may be
  beyond the capability of a single AI.
- **Extensibility:** Design the protocol to be adaptable to future advancements
  in AI and communication technologies.

### 1.1.3. Scope (Version 0.1)

This version (0.1) focuses on establishing the foundational elements of the HSP,
including:

- Core information types for knowledge sharing and tasking.
- Basic communication patterns (Publish/Subscribe, Request/Response).
- A standardized message envelope.
- Initial concepts for AI discovery, capability advertisement, and trust.

**Note on Implementation Status:** While these concepts are defined, their full
implementation and integration are ongoing. Specifically, the
`ServiceDiscoveryModule` requires significant refactoring to align with the
intended HSP role, and related integration tests are currently failing.

### 1.1.4. Guiding Principles

- **Decentralization:** Favor decentralized mechanisms where feasible to enhance
  resilience and avoid single points of failure.
- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Strive for clear and understandable specifications.
- **Security & Trust:** Build in considerations for security and trust from the
  ground up.
- **Flexibility:** Allow for various underlying network topologies and transport
  protocols.
- **Evolvability:** Design with future extensions and versioning in mind.

## 1.2. Core Concepts

### 1.2.1. HSP Participant AI (HPA)

An HSP Participant AI (HPA), or simply "AI," is any software entity capable of
sending and receiving messages according to this HSP specification. Each HPA is
expected to have a unique identifier.

### 1.2.2. High-Level Architectural Overview

HSP is designed to be flexible regarding network architecture. It can support:

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) interactions:** Direct communication between AIs.
- **Broker-mediated communication:** For patterns like Publish/Subscribe,
  potentially using message brokers (e.g., MQTT, Kafka).
- **Federated systems:** Groups of AIs forming local networks connected via
  gateways.

The specific network topology is an implementation choice, but HSP messages are
designed to be routable across different configurations.
