# Knowledge Distillation Manager

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `KnowledgeDistillationManager` module (`src/core_ai/learning/knowledge_distillation.py`). This module is responsible for managing the process of knowledge distillation, where knowledge from a large, complex "teacher" model is transferred to a smaller, more efficient "student" model.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `KnowledgeDistillationManager` is to enable the creation of smaller, computationally cheaper models that retain the performance of larger, more powerful models. This is crucial for deploying AI capabilities in resource-constrained environments (e.g., on-device, edge computing) where the original "teacher" model would be too slow or memory-intensive.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Distillation Process (`distill_knowledge`)**:
    *   Orchestrates the main training loop for knowledge distillation.
    *   For each batch of training data, it gets predictions from both the teacher and student models.
    *   It calculates a `distillation_loss` which measures the difference between the student's and teacher's outputs. This loss guides the student model to mimic the teacher's behavior.
    *   Simulates the backpropagation process to update the student model's weights (in a real implementation, this would involve an optimizer).
*   **Evaluation (`evaluate_distillation`)**:
    *   Provides a mechanism to evaluate and compare the performance of both the teacher and student models on a separate test dataset.
    *   Calculates a `distillation_ratio` to quantify how successfully the student has learned from the teacher.
*   **Distillation Loss (`DistillationLoss`)**:
    *   A placeholder class representing the loss function used in distillation.
    *   In a real-world scenario, this would typically involve comparing the softened probability distributions of the teacher and student models using a metric like Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

## How it Works

The `KnowledgeDistillationManager` takes a "teacher" model and a "student" model as input. During the `distill_knowledge` process, it feeds training data to both models. The output of the teacher model (often the logits or probabilities from the pre-softmax layer) is treated as "soft labels." The student model is then trained to not only predict the correct ground-truth labels but also to replicate the soft labels produced by the teacher. This allows the student to learn the nuanced decision-making process and generalization capabilities of the larger teacher model, resulting in a more capable and robust smaller model.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **Teacher and Student Models**: The manager requires two model objects that expose a `predict` method. These models can be any type of machine learning model, but are typically neural networks.
*   **Data Services**: The manager consumes training and testing data, which would be provided by a data loading or data management service within the AI ecosystem.
