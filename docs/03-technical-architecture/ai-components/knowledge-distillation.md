# KnowledgeDistillationManager: Compressing AI Models

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `KnowledgeDistillationManager` module, located at `apps/backend/src/core_ai/learning/knowledge_distillation.py`. This module is part of the continuous learning framework, focusing on model optimization.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of knowledge distillation is to transfer knowledge from a large, complex "teacher" model to a smaller, more efficient "student" model. The `KnowledgeDistillationManager` orchestrates this process, allowing the AI system to create smaller models that retain most of the performance of the larger ones, making them faster and less resource-intensive to run.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Model Management**: The manager is initialized with a `teacher_model` and a `student_model`.
*   **Distillation Process (`distill_knowledge`)**: It iterates through training data, gets predictions from both the teacher and student models, and calculates a `distillation_loss`. This loss function (currently a placeholder) would typically encourage the student model's outputs to mimic the teacher's outputs.
*   **Loss Calculation**: Utilizes a `DistillationLoss` class (currently a placeholder) to compute the difference between the teacher's and student's predictions. In a real implementation, this would involve techniques like using a "temperature" parameter to soften the teacher's output probabilities.
*   **Evaluation (`evaluate_distillation`)**: Provides a method to compare the performance (e.g., accuracy) of the student model against the teacher model on a test dataset to measure the effectiveness of the distillation process.

## How it Works

The manager takes a large, well-trained teacher model and a smaller student model. It then runs a training loop where the student model is trained not on the ground-truth labels, but on the outputs (or "soft labels") produced by the teacher model. The goal is for the student to learn the teacher's reasoning process, effectively compressing the knowledge into a smaller architecture.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`LearningManager`**: The `LearningManager` could initiate the knowledge distillation process, perhaps after a teacher model has reached a certain performance threshold or when a smaller, specialized model is needed.
*   **AI Models**: This module directly interacts with any model objects that have a `predict` method, treating them as either a teacher or a student.
