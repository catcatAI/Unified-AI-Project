# EnvironmentSimulator: AI World Model and Action Consequence Simulation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `EnvironmentSimulator` module (`src/core_ai/world_model/environment_simulator.py`). This module is designed to simulate the consequences of AI actions within its internal world model, including predicting future states, estimating uncertainty, and generating multiple possible scenarios.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `EnvironmentSimulator` is to empower the AI to perform internal "thought experiments" or simulations before committing to an action in the real world. This capability allows the AI to anticipate potential outcomes, evaluate associated risks, and choose actions that are more likely to lead to desired results, thereby significantly improving its decision-making, planning, and strategic capabilities.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Action Consequence Simulation (`simulate_action_consequences`)**:
    *   **State Prediction**: Utilizes a `StatePredictor` (currently a placeholder class) to forecast the next state of the environment given the current state and a proposed action.
    *   **Uncertainty Estimation**: Employs an `UncertaintyEstimator` (a placeholder class) to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted future state, providing a measure of prediction reliability.
    *   **Expected Reward Calculation**: Computes the anticipated reward for a given action, guiding the AI towards beneficial outcomes.
    *   **Scenario Generation**: Generates multiple possible future scenarios (e.g., most likely, optimistic, pessimistic) to provide a richer, more comprehensive understanding of potential outcomes and their probabilities.
*   **Model Update from Experience (`update_model_from_experience`)**: Enables the simulator's internal models (including the state predictor, action effect model, and uncertainty estimator) to be continuously updated and refined based on actual observed experiences. This mechanism facilitates continuous learning and adaptation of the AI's world model.
*   **Internal Placeholder Models**: The core functionalities of the simulator rely on placeholder classes (`StatePredictor`, `ActionEffectModel`, `UncertaintyEstimator`). In a full implementation, these would be replaced by more sophisticated, potentially AI-driven, predictive and analytical models.

## How it Works

The `EnvironmentSimulator` functions as a miniature, internal "world" where the AI can test out hypothetical actions. It leverages its internal predictive models to determine how the environment will change in response to an action, how uncertain those predictions are, and what rewards can be expected. By generating multiple scenarios, it provides the AI with a range of possibilities to consider, allowing for more robust planning. The simulator's models are continuously refined by comparing their predictions with actual observed outcomes from the real environment, fostering a self-improving loop.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`StatePredictor`, `ActionEffectModel`, `UncertaintyEstimator`**: These are internal conceptual components that would be implemented with more advanced AI models (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning agents) in a production system.
*   **`ExecutionManager` or `PlanningModule`**: Higher-level modules responsible for AI decision-making and task execution would likely utilize this `EnvironmentSimulator` to evaluate potential actions and strategies before committing to their execution in the real world.
