# MetaFormulasUndefinedField: Representing Unknown Semantic Space

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `undefined_field.py` module (`src/core_ai/meta_formulas/undefined_field.py`). This module defines the `UndefinedField` class, which is designed to represent an unknown semantic space within the context of meta-formulas, providing a mechanism to probe for boundary information.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `UndefinedField` is to explicitly model and handle situations where a meta-formula encounters an undefined or unknown semantic concept during its operation. This allows the AI system to acknowledge its limitations, gather more information about the unknown, and potentially adapt its reasoning, seek clarification from external sources, or trigger specific learning processes, rather than simply failing silently or producing incorrect results.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Representation of Unknowns**: The `UndefinedField` class encapsulates a `context` string. This string serves as a descriptive label for the area or concept that is currently undefined or unknown to the meta-formula. It provides a human-readable reference to the problematic semantic space.
*   **`probe` Method**: A placeholder method that is intended to "probe" the undefined field. In a fully implemented system, this method would contain logic to attempt to gain more information about the boundaries, characteristics, or potential definitions of the unknown concept. This could involve querying external knowledge bases, performing further analysis, or initiating a dialogue with a human operator.

## How it Works

Instances of `UndefinedField` are created when a meta-formula encounters a semantic space for which it does not have a clear or complete definition. Instead of halting execution or returning an error, the meta-formula can return an `UndefinedField` object. This object can then be processed by other components of the AI system. The `probe` method is a conceptual hook for future development, allowing the system to attempt to resolve or gain more information about these unknowns, thereby enabling more sophisticated and adaptive behavior in the face of incomplete knowledge.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`MetaFormula` (Conceptual)**: Meta-formulas (subclasses of `MetaFormula` from `meta_formula.py`) would likely return `UndefinedField` instances when they cannot fully resolve a semantic space or require more information to proceed.
*   **`MetaFormulaEvaluator` (Conceptual)**: A component responsible for evaluating meta-formulas would interpret `UndefinedField` instances. It would decide on appropriate strategies to handle them, such as asking for clarification from the user, logging the unknown for human review, or triggering a learning process to define the new semantic space.
*   **Knowledge Acquisition Modules**: Future modules focused on knowledge acquisition or learning might implement the logic within the `probe` method to expand the AI's understanding of previously undefined concepts.
