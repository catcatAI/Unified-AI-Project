# Calculator Tool

## Overview

The `calculator_tool.py` (`src/tools/calculator_tool.py`) provides the AI with the capability to **perform basic mathematical calculations** by evaluating a given mathematical expression. It serves as a fundamental utility for any AI task that requires numerical computation or logical evaluation of arithmetic statements.

## Key Functionality

-   **`calculate(expression: str) -> Any`**:
    *   Takes a string `expression` representing a mathematical formula (e.g., "2 + 2 * 3", "(10 / 2) - 1").
    *   Uses Python's built-in `eval()` function to compute the result of the expression.
    *   Returns the calculated value.

## How it Works

The `calculate` function directly utilizes Python's `eval()` function. While `eval()` is powerful for evaluating arbitrary expressions, its use in production environments requires careful consideration due to potential security risks if the input `expression` is not sanitized or comes from untrusted sources. In the context of this project, it is assumed that inputs to this tool are either controlled or pre-validated by higher-level AI components (like the `DailyLanguageModel` or `ToolDispatcher`).

## Integration with Other Modules

-   **`ToolDispatcher`**: The `ToolDispatcher` would invoke the `calculate` function when the AI's intent is recognized as requiring a mathematical operation.
-   **`DailyLanguageModel`**: The `DailyLanguageModel` (or a similar intent recognition module) would be responsible for parsing user queries and extracting the mathematical `expression` to be passed to this tool.
-   **`ProjectCoordinator`**: Complex tasks involving numerical analysis or data manipulation might leverage this tool as a sub-step.
