# TimeSystem Module

## Overview

*   **Module Name**: `TimeSystem`
*   **Brief Description**: Placeholder class for an AI's time perception and management module.
*   **Purpose**: Serves as a conceptual component for managing an AI's understanding of and interaction with time. In a full implementation, this module would provide functionalities for time tracking, event scheduling, and potentially influencing the AI's temporal reasoning.

## Key Responsibilities and Functionality

*   Currently, it is an empty class, serving as a conceptual marker.

## How it Works

*   As a placeholder, it does not perform any operations. It is a structural element within the codebase.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   Any modules requiring time-aware operations or scheduling would interact with a fully implemented `TimeSystem`.

## Code Location

*   `src/core_ai/time_system.py`
