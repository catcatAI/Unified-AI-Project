# SimultaneousTranslation: Lightweight Mock for Real-time Translation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `SimultaneousTranslation` module (`src/core_ai/simultaneous_translation.py`). This module serves as a lightweight, mock implementation of a simultaneous translation engine.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to act as a placeholder for a real-time, streaming translation service. It provides a minimal, dependency-free interface that allows other AI components to be designed and developed with the expectation of real-time translation capabilities, even if the full, production-ready implementation is not yet available. This facilitates parallel development and system integration.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Synchronous Translation (`translate`)**: Takes a text string, an optional source language, and an optional target language. In this mock implementation, it simply echoes the original text as the "translated" text. It returns a structured payload that includes metadata such as `source_lang`, `target_lang`, `original_text`, `translated_text`, `confidence`, and a simulated `latency_ms`.
*   **Streaming Translation (`stream_translate`)**: A generator function that takes a list of text chunks. It simulates a streaming translation process by yielding partial translation results for each chunk. Similar to the synchronous method, it echoes the input chunks as "translated" text and simulates latency between chunks using `time.sleep()`. It also provides `is_final` and `confidence` flags for each chunk.

## How it Works

The `SimultaneousTranslation` module is a pure placeholder. It does not perform any actual linguistic translation. Instead, it simulates the behavior of a real-time translation service by returning the input text as output and adding mock metadata like confidence and latency. This allows for the testing and development of components that rely on simultaneous translation without requiring a complex backend or external API calls during the initial development phases.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **`AudioService`**: Could potentially utilize this module for real-time audio translation, where spoken input is translated on the fly.
*   **`DialogueManager`**: Could integrate with this module for real-time translation of user input or AI responses, enabling multilingual conversations.
