# Creation Engine

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `CreationEngine` module (`src/creation/creation_engine.py`). This module is a simple utility designed to dynamically generate boilerplate Python code for new AI models and tools based on a textual query.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `CreationEngine` is to automate and standardize the initial creation of new AI components. By taking a simple query, it can scaffold the basic structure of a model class or a tool function, providing a consistent and predictable starting template for developers. This helps to accelerate the development process and ensures that new components adhere to a common structural pattern.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Component Scaffolding (`create`)**: The main entry point that takes a query (e.g., "create my_model model" or "create my_tool tool"). It determines whether to create a model or a tool and dispatches to the appropriate internal method.
*   **Model Creation (`_create_model`)**: Generates the source code for a Python class representing a model. The template includes placeholder `__init__`, `train`, and `evaluate` methods, complete with docstrings.
*   **Tool Creation (`_create_tool`)**: Generates the source code for a Python function representing a tool. The template includes a basic function signature, a docstring, and a placeholder implementation.

## How it Works

The `CreationEngine` works through simple string parsing and f-string-based templating. When the `create` method is called, it analyzes the query to extract the desired name for the new model or tool. It then injects this name into a hardcoded Python code template. The final output is a string containing the generated, ready-to-use boilerplate code.

## Integration with Other Modules

The `CreationEngine` is a largely standalone utility. It does not have complex dependencies on other modules. However, its output is intended to be used by developers as the starting point for creating new models and tools that will then be integrated with other parts of the AI system, such as the `ToolDispatcher` or `AgentManager`.
