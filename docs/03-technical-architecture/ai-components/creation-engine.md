# Creation Engine

## Overview

The `CreationEngine` (`src/creation/creation_engine.py`) is a fascinating meta-programming component within the Unified-AI-Project. Its primary function is to **dynamically generate boilerplate code for new AI models and tools** based on high-level queries. This capability hints at the AI's potential for self-extension and autonomous development, allowing it to adapt and grow its own functionalities.

This module is crucial for scenarios where the AI needs to rapidly prototype new capabilities or integrate new types of models/tools into its ecosystem without manual human intervention for initial code setup.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

1.  **Dynamic Code Generation (`create`)**:
    *   Takes a natural language `query` (e.g., "create a sentiment analysis model", "create a web scraping tool").
    *   Identifies whether the request is for a `model` or a `tool`.
    *   Dispatches the request to the appropriate internal method (`_create_model` or `_create_tool`).

2.  **Model Code Generation (`_create_model`)**:
    *   Generates a Python class template for a new AI model.
    *   The generated template includes:
        *   A class definition with the specified model name.
        *   An `__init__` method for initialization.
        *   Placeholder methods for `train` (to train the model on a dataset) and `evaluate` (to evaluate the model on an input).

3.  **Tool Code Generation (`_create_tool`)**:
    *   Generates a Python function template for a new AI tool.
    *   The generated template includes:
        *   A function definition with the specified tool name.
        *   A docstring explaining the tool's purpose.
        *   Placeholder logic for processing input and returning output.

## How it Works

When `create` is called, the `CreationEngine` parses the input query to determine the type of code to generate. It then uses f-strings and predefined templates to construct the Python code as a string. This generated code can then be written to a file, allowing the AI to effectively "write" new modules for itself or other agents.

## Integration and Importance

-   **`ProjectCoordinator`**: Could potentially leverage the `CreationEngine` as part of a larger task to dynamically create and integrate new specialized agents or tools required for complex projects.
-   **`LearningManager`**: In advanced scenarios, the `LearningManager` might identify a need for a new type of model or tool and trigger the `CreationEngine` to generate its initial structure.
-   **AI Self-Improvement**: This module is a foundational piece for the AI's ability to self-modify and self-improve, allowing it to expand its own capabilities autonomously.
