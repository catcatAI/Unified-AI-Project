# Evaluator

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the `Evaluator` module (`src/evaluation/evaluator.py`). This module provides a standardized framework for evaluating the performance and quality of AI models and tools within the project.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `Evaluator` is to offer a consistent and reusable way to assess AI components. By calculating key metrics such as accuracy, performance (speed), and robustness, it allows developers to benchmark different models and tools, track improvements over time, and ensure that components meet a certain quality standard before being integrated into the broader system.

## Key Responsibilities and Features

*   **Comprehensive Evaluation (`evaluate`)**: The main entry point that takes a component (a model or tool) and a dataset, and returns a dictionary containing a full suite of evaluation metrics.
*   **Accuracy Calculation (`_calculate_accuracy`)**: Measures the correctness of a component. It iterates through a dataset, compares the component's actual output with the expected output, and calculates an accuracy score.
*   **Performance Measurement (`_calculate_performance`)**: Measures the speed of a component. It records the total time taken to process all items in the evaluation dataset.
*   **Robustness Assessment (`_calculate_robustness`)**: Measures the stability of a component. It calculates the percentage of inputs in the dataset that the component can process without raising an exception.

## How it Works

The `Evaluator` is designed to be a generic utility. It expects the component to be evaluated to have an `evaluate(input)` method and the dataset to be an iterable of (input, expected_output) pairs. The main `evaluate` method orchestrates the process by calling the internal calculation methods for each metric and compiling the results into a summary dictionary.

## Integration with Other Modules

*   **Models and Tools**: The `Evaluator` is designed to work with any model or tool that adheres to the expected interface (i.e., possesses an `evaluate` method). This includes components generated by the `CreationEngine`.
*   **Datasets**: It consumes datasets which would be provided by data management or testing modules.
