# Game Design

This section details the integrated game components of the Unified AI Project, centered around "Angela's World."

## Angela's World

"Angela's World" is a unique AI-driven simulation game that serves as both a demonstration platform for the project's AI capabilities and an engaging user experience. The game features Angela, a central AI character powered by the project's backend systems.

### Game Concept

The game combines elements of a virtual pet, economic simulation, and interactive storytelling. Players interact with Angela, who exhibits autonomous behavior, learns from interactions, and evolves over time. The game world is dynamically generated and influenced by Angela's decisions and the player's actions.

### Core Mechanics

1. **AI-Driven Narrative**: The story unfolds through Angela's interactions with the player and her environment. Her responses are generated by the AI models and evolve based on learned experiences.

2. **Economic System**: A complex economic system where Angela can earn, spend, and invest resources. This system is designed to demonstrate the AI's planning and decision-making capabilities.

3. **Virtual Pet Elements**: Angela exhibits pet-like behaviors, forming emotional bonds with players, expressing needs, and responding to care and attention.

4. **Exploration and Discovery**: Players can explore dynamically generated environments, discovering new content that Angela helps create or modify based on learned patterns.

### Technical Integration

The game serves as a practical application of the project's AI technologies:

- **Multi-Modal AI Agents**: Different agents handle various aspects of Angela's behavior (creative writing, image generation, web search).
- **HAM Memory System**: Angela's memories and learned experiences are stored and retrieved using the Hierarchical Abstract Memory system.
- **HSP Protocol**: Enables seamless communication between game components and external AI services.
- **Continuous Learning**: Angela's behavior evolves through continuous interaction and learning.

### Development Framework

The game is built using Electron for cross-platform compatibility, with a React-based frontend and the Python backend providing AI capabilities. The web-based dashboard allows developers to monitor and manage the AI systems powering the game.
