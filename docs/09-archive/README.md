This directory contains documents preserved for historical context. The items here, such as project restructuring plans or legacy summaries, track the evolution of the project but **do not** reflect its current state.

All technical documentation has been migrated to the main `docs` directories, and all code history is managed by Git. Please do not reference this directory for current technical specifications or implementation details.
