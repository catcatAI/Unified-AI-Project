# TODO Analysis and Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed analysis of the `TODO` items found in the codebase and outlines a plan for their implementation.

## 1. System Health & Monitoring

**Status:** Completed

### 1.1. Comprehensive Health Check

- **File:** `scripts/health_check.py`
- **Description:** The health check script is a standalone utility for verifying the status of the system's core components. The script has been implemented to perform the following checks:
    - **API Health**: Pings the main API server to ensure it is responsive.
    - **Firebase Credentials**: Verifies that the `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` environment variable is set and that the credential file exists.
    - **MQTT Broker**: Connects to the MQTT broker to ensure it is running and accessible.
    - **Firestore Database**: Connects to the Firestore database and performs a simple write/read operation to verify its health.
- **Status:** The implementation is complete. The script provides a good baseline for monitoring the system's health.
