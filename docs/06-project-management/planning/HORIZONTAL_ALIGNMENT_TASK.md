# Horizontal Alignment Task

This document outlines the high-level task of "horizontally aligning the projects."

## Goal

The primary goal of this task is to analyze the different sub-projects within this monorepo (backend, frontend-dashboard, desktop-app, cli) and identify their strengths and weaknesses. The ultimate objective is to apply the advantages of each sub-project to the others, creating a more unified and consistent developer experience and final product.

## Key Areas of Focus

*   **Code Style and Conventions**: Are the sub-projects using consistent code styles and conventions? Can we create a shared linting configuration?
*   **Dependency Management**: Are the sub-projects using the same versions of shared dependencies? Can we centralize the management of these dependencies?
*   **Build and Test Processes**: Are the build and test processes for each sub-project consistent? Can we create a unified set of scripts for building and testing the entire monorepo?
*   **Shared Components and Libraries**: Are there components or libraries that are being re-implemented in multiple sub-projects? Can we extract these into a shared library?
*   **Architectural Patterns**: Are the sub-projects using similar architectural patterns? Can we learn from the successes and failures of each sub-project's architecture?

## Proposed Action Plan

1.  **Audit each sub-project**: Create a detailed report on the current state of each sub-project, focusing on the key areas listed above.
2.  **Identify opportunities for alignment**: Based on the audit, identify specific opportunities for horizontal alignment.
3.  **Create a prioritized roadmap**: Create a prioritized roadmap of tasks for implementing the identified alignment opportunities.
4.  **Implement the roadmap**: Execute the roadmap, one task at a time.
