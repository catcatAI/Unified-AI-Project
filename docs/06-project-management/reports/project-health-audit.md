# Project Health Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-04

This document summarizes the findings of a project-wide health audit. The audit focused on identifying issues related to dependency management, testing, code quality, and documentation.

## 1. Summary of Findings

The audit uncovered several issues, with the most critical being in Python dependency management for the backend service. This issue prevents new developers from successfully running the backend. Other major issues include a non-functional backend test runner and several code quality inconsistencies.

The following sections detail the specific findings and provide recommendations.

## 2. Detailed Findings and Recommendations

### 2.1. Dependency Management (Severity: Critical)

*   **Issue:** The `apps/backend/requirements.txt` file is dangerously out of sync with the canonical `pyproject.toml`. It is missing numerous critical dependencies (e.g., `numpy`, `requests`, `openai`, `spacy`).
*   **Impact:** The `dev` script for the backend (`pnpm --filter backend dev`) will **fail at runtime** due to `ModuleNotFoundError`. This makes the project's backend unusable for any developer following the setup instructions.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Stop manually editing `requirements.txt` files.**
    2.  **Adopt a tool to generate `requirements.txt` from `pyproject.toml`.** A common tool for this is `pip-tools` (specifically `pip-compile`).
    3.  A script should be added to the project (e.g., `scripts/generate_requirements.sh`) that runs `pip-compile` to regenerate `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` based on the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`. This ensures a single source of truth.

*   **Issue:** The `requirements-dev.txt` file is a manual duplication of dependencies.
*   **Impact:** This is error-prone and makes dependency updates difficult to manage.
*   **Recommendation:** This file should also be generated automatically from `pyproject.toml`, likely from a combination of the main `dependencies` and the `testing` optional-dependencies group.

### 2.2. Testing Environment (Severity: Major)

*   **Issue:** The backend Python test suite was not being executed by the project's main `pnpm test` command. The script was a placeholder that skipped the tests.
*   **Impact:** This allows bugs and regressions in the Python backend to go completely undetected by the primary testing workflow.
*   **Status:** **FIXED**. This was addressed in a previous commit by updating `apps/backend/package.json` to correctly install dependencies and run `pytest`.

### 2.3. Code Quality and Consistency

*   **Issue:** Inconsistent logging practices. Some new modules use `print()` for logging (`FactExtractorModule`) while older modules use the standard `logging` library (`HAMMemoryManager`).
*   **Impact:** Complicates debugging and makes it difficult to control log verbosity in a production environment.
*   **Recommendation:** A project-wide convention should be established to use the standard `logging` module. A linting rule could potentially enforce this. All existing `print()` statements used for logging should be refactored.
*   **Status:** **Partially Fixed.** The `FactExtractorModule` was refactored to use `logging` in a previous commit. A wider audit may be needed.

*   **Issue:** Use of hardcoded values in core components.
*   **Impact:** Reduces flexibility, making the system harder to configure and test.
*   **Recommendation:** Continue to identify and refactor hardcoded values (like model IDs, prompts, or paths) into a proper configuration management system (e.g., loading from YAML files or environment variables).
*   **Status:** **Partially Fixed.** The hardcoded path in `scripts/health_check.py` and the hardcoded model ID in `FactExtractorModule` were fixed in previous commits.

### 2.4. Documentation

*   **Issue:** Key project status documents (`PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`, `TODO_ANALYSIS.md`) were found to be significantly out of date with the codebase.
*   **Impact:** This caused developer confusion and wasted effort investigating issues that were already resolved.
*   **Recommendation:** A process should be put in place to ensure documentation is updated as part of the development workflow when a task is completed.
*   **Status:** **FIXED.** These specific documents were updated in previous commits.

## 3. Update on Remediation Attempts (as of 2025-08-04)

An attempt was made to fix the **Critical** "Dependency Management" issue by creating a script to generate the `requirements.txt` files from `pyproject.toml` using `pip-tools`.

*   **Action:** A plan was made to add `pip-tools` and use `pip-compile` to generate the correct dependency files.
*   **Blocker:** The execution of `pip-compile` failed due to an `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`.
*   **Conclusion:** The sandbox environment lacks the necessary disk space to resolve and download the project's extensive dependencies. This is a fundamental environmental constraint that prevents the dependency files from being correctly generated at this time.
*   **Recommendation for Future Work:** The proposed solution (using `pip-tools` to generate requirements from `pyproject.toml`) remains the correct one. It should be executed in a development environment with sufficient disk space (>5GB recommended to be safe). The `scripts/generate_requirements.sh` script, which was created but could not be run, contains the correct commands to perform this action.
