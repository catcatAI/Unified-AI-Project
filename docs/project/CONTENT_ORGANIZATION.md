# Unified-AI-Project: Content Organization

## Introduction

This document provides an organized overview of the Unified-AI-Project's content. Its purpose is to help contributors and users understand the project's structure, navigate the codebase and documentation, and locate relevant information efficiently.

The project structure and documentation are subject to ongoing evolution. This document describes the organization as of the last major documentation restructuring (July 11, 2024). For the most current status of individual components and features, please refer to the [Project Status Summary](STATUS_SUMMARY.md). For a comprehensive, navigable list of all key documents, please refer to the [Project Table of Contents](../CONTENTS.md).

## 1. Top-Level Project Files

These files are located in the root directory of the project:

*   `README.md`: The main entry point for the project. Provides a general overview, setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and links to key documentation, especially [../CONTENTS.md](../CONTENTS.md).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
*   `package.json`: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts, primarily for the Electron application and other Node.js-based services or tools.
*   `.env.example`: An example environment variable file. Users should copy this to `.env` and fill in their specific configurations (e.g., API keys).
*   `babel.cfg`: Configuration file for Babel, used for internationalization (i18n) to extract translatable strings from Python source code.
*   Other configuration files (e.g., for linters, formatters, CI/CD) may also be present.

## 2. Source Code (`src/`)

The `src/` directory contains all the core Python source code for the AI, its services, tools, and interfaces. Key subdirectories include:

*   `agents/`: Contains specialized capability modules, such as `JulesDevelopmentCapability` for AI-assisted software development tasks. These are typically orchestrated by the core AI persona.
*   `core_ai/`: Houses the central intelligence and decision-making components of the AI, including dialogue management, memory (HAM), learning systems, personality, formula engine, and more.
*   `fragmenta/`: Home of the Fragmenta Orchestrator, a system designed for managing complex tasks and coordinating data flow between modules.
*   `hsp/`: Implements the Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol (HSP) for inter-AI communication and collaboration.
*   `interfaces/`: Contains code for different user interaction points, such as the Command Line Interface (`cli/`) and the Electron desktop application (`electron_app/`).
*   `modules_fragmenta/`: Contains specialized processing modules that can be utilized by the Fragmenta system.
*   `services/`: Backend services, including the main API server (FastAPI), interfaces to Large Language Models (LLMs), AIVirtualInputService (AVIS), SandboxExecutor, and other utility services.
*   `shared/`: Common utilities, type definitions (`TypedDict`s), and constants used across different parts of the project.
*   `tools/`: Contains internal "tools" that the AI can use to augment its capabilities, such as mathematical tools, logical reasoners, or translation tools, along with their respective models or dispatchers.

Many modules within `src/` have their own `README.md` or `*_readme.md` files providing specific details about their functionality and usage, often linked from [../CONTENTS.md](../CONTENTS.md).
