# Backend Package

This package contains the core Python backend services for the Unified AI Project.

## Features

- AI models and logic
- API endpoints (FastAPI)
- Integrations with external services
- Data processing and management

## Getting Started

To run the backend development server:

```bash
pnpm --filter backend dev
```

## Running Tests

To run tests for the backend:

```bash
pnpm --filter backend test
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pnpm --filter backend test:coverage
```
