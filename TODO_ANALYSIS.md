# TODO Analysis and Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed analysis of the `TODO` items found in the codebase and outlines a plan for their implementation.

## 1. System Health & Monitoring

**Status:** In Progress

### 1.1. Incomprehensive Health Check

- **File:** `scripts/health_check.py`
- **Description:** The health check script is a standalone utility for verifying the status of the system's components. It currently checks the main API server and the existence of the Firebase credentials file. However, the check for the database is just a placeholder and needs to be implemented.
- **Task:** Implement the `check_database` function to provide a comprehensive health check of the system. This will likely involve connecting to the database and performing a simple query to ensure it is responsive.

- **Relevant Code:**
  ```python
  def check_database():
      """Placeholder for checking database health."""
      logging.info("Checking database health (placeholder)...")
      logging.warning("No database configuration found. Skipping database health check.")
  ```
