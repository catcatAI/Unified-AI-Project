Fix backend import timeout issues (P1-2)

- Refactored service initialization in main_api_server to use lazy loading
- Implemented lazy singleton pattern for cluster_manager and sync_manager
- Deferred memory enhancement module imports in angela_llm_service (5.5s to 0.6s)
- Lazy load PetManager in pet API endpoint
- Updated all route handlers to use service getter functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with proxy classes

All services now initialize during startup event instead of at import time.

Changes:
- apps/backend/src/services/main_api_server.py: Service lazy loading
- apps/backend/src/system/cluster_manager.py: Lazy singleton
- apps/backend/src/core/sync/realtime_sync.py: Lazy singleton
- apps/backend/src/services/angela_llm_service.py: Lazy memory imports
- apps/backend/src/api/v1/endpoints/pet.py: Lazy PetManager

Performance: angela_llm_service import reduced from 5.49s to 0.61s (89% improvement)
