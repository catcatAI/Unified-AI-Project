## 5. Design Solutions

### 5.1 Standardization Framework

#### 5.1.1 Common Header Template
All batch files will implement a standardized header:
```batch
@echo off
chcp 65001 >nul 2>&1
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
title Unified AI Project - [Script Name]
color 0A

:: Standard error handling and logging
set "LOG_FILE=%~dp0[script-name]-errors.log"
set "SCRIPT_NAME=[script-name].bat"
echo [%date% %time%] Script started: %SCRIPT_NAME% >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
```

#### 5.1.2 Error Handling Standard
```batch
:: Check for required tools
where [tool] >nul 2>&1
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo [ERROR] [tool] not installed
    echo [%date% %time%] [tool] not installed >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    echo Press any key to exit...
    pause >nul
    exit /b 1
)
```

#### 5.1.3 Path Resolution Standard
```batch
:: Use %~dp0 for consistent path resolution
set "PROJECT_ROOT=%~dp0"
cd /d "%PROJECT_ROOT%"
```

### 5.2 Modular Architecture

#### 5.2.1 Common Functions Library
Create `tools\common-functions.bat` with reusable functions:
- `check_environment` - Verify required tools
- `setup_logging` - Initialize logging
- `handle_error` - Standardized error handling
- `validate_input` - Input validation
- `cleanup` - Resource cleanup

#### 5.2.2 Script Organization
1. **Core Scripts** - Main entry points in project root
2. **Tool Scripts** - Specialized functionality in `tools/` directory
3. **Helper Scripts** - Utility functions in `scripts/` directory
4. **App-Specific Scripts** - Application-specific in respective directories

### 5.3 Enhanced Error Handling

#### 5.3.1 Comprehensive Error Logging
```batch
:: Enhanced error logging with context
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo [ERROR] Failed to [operation]
    echo [CONTEXT] Working directory: %cd%
    echo [CONTEXT] Script: %SCRIPT_NAME%
    echo [CONTEXT] Command: [command that failed]
    echo [%date% %time%] ERROR: [operation] failed in %SCRIPT_NAME% >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    echo [SOLUTION] [suggested solution]
    exit /b 1
)
```

#### 5.3.2 Graceful Degradation
```batch
:: Allow continuing with warnings for non-critical failures
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo [WARNING] [operation] failed but continuing
    echo [%date% %time%] WARNING: [operation] failed in %SCRIPT_NAME% >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
)
```

### 5.4 Input Validation Improvements

#### 5.4.1 Robust Input Handling
```batch
:: Improved input validation
:get_user_input
set "user_input="
set /p "user_input=Enter value: "
if not defined user_input (
    echo [ERROR] No input provided
    echo [%date% %time%] No input provided >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    goto get_user_input
)
set "user_input=%user_input: =%"  :: Trim whitespace
```

### 5.5 Path Resolution Fixes

#### 5.5.1 Consistent Path Handling
```batch
:: Use absolute paths derived from script location
set "PROJECT_ROOT=%~dp0"
if "%PROJECT_ROOT:~-1%"=="\" set "PROJECT_ROOT=%PROJECT_ROOT:~0,-1%"
cd /d "%PROJECT_ROOT%"
```

### 5.6 Virtual Environment Management

#### 5.6.1 Standardized Virtual Environment Handling
```batch
:: Check and activate virtual environment
if exist "venv\Scripts\activate.bat" (
    call venv\Scripts\activate.bat >nul 2>&1
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo [ERROR] Failed to activate virtual environment
        echo [%date% %time%] Failed to activate virtual environment >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        exit /b 1
    )
) else (
    echo [ERROR] Virtual environment not found
    echo [%date% %time%] Virtual environment not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    exit /b 1
)

:: Ensure deactivation at script end
:end_script
if defined VIRTUAL_ENV (
    call venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat >nul 2>&1
)
```

## 5.7 Functional Corrections and Debugging

### 5.7.1 Test Selection Logic Fixes

One of the key issues identified is the automatic test selection behavior in several scripts. Scripts should prompt users for input rather than automatically selecting default options when no input is provided.

#### Problem
Several scripts automatically default to running all tests when no test type is specified, without giving users a chance to select:
```batch
:: Current problematic implementation
if "%1"=="" (
    echo [INFO] No test type specified. Running all tests by default...
    set "test_type=all"
) else (
    set "test_type=%1"
)
```

#### Solution
Implement proper user interaction for test selection:
```batch
:: Improved implementation with user interaction
if "%1"=="" (
    echo Available test options:
    echo   all      - Run all tests
    echo   backend  - Run backend tests only
    echo   frontend - Run frontend tests only
    echo   unit     - Run unit tests only
    echo   integration - Run integration tests only
    echo.
    set "test_type="
    set /p "test_type=Enter test type (or press Enter for all): "
    if not defined test_type set "test_type=all"
) else (
    set "test_type=%1"
)
```

### 5.7.2 Input Validation Improvements

#### 5.7.2.1 Robust Input Validation for Menu Selections
```batch
:: Enhanced menu selection validation
:get_user_choice
set "user_choice="
set /p "user_choice=Enter your choice: "
if not defined user_choice (
    echo [ERROR] No input provided. Please try again.
    echo [%date% %time%] No input provided in menu selection >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    goto get_user_choice
)

:: Validate numeric input for menu choices
set "user_choice=%user_choice: =%"
for %%i in (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14) do (
    if "%user_choice%"=="%%i" (
        goto choice_%%i
    )
)

echo [ERROR] Invalid choice '%user_choice%'. Please enter a valid option.
    echo [%date% %time%] Invalid menu choice: %user_choice% >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
goto get_user_choice
```

### 5.7.3 Error Handling for Test Execution

#### 5.7.3.1 Comprehensive Test Error Handling
```batch
:: Enhanced test execution with proper error handling
:run_tests
if "%test_type%"=="backend" (
    echo [TEST] Running backend tests...
    echo [%date% %time%] Running backend tests >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    
    :: Check if backend directory exists
    if not exist "apps\backend" (
        echo [ERROR] Backend directory not found
        echo [%date% %time%] Backend directory not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        echo Press any key to return to menu...
        pause >nul
        exit /b 1
    )
    
    :: Activate virtual environment
    if exist "apps\backend\venv\Scripts\activate.bat" (
        call apps\backend\venv\Scripts\activate.bat >nul 2>&1
        if errorlevel 1 (
            echo [ERROR] Failed to activate virtual environment
            echo [%date% %time%] Failed to activate virtual environment >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
            echo Press any key to return to menu...
            pause >nul
            exit /b 1
        )
    ) else (
        echo [ERROR] Virtual environment not found
        echo [%date% %time%] Virtual environment not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        echo Press any key to return to menu...
        pause >nul
        exit /b 1
    )
    
    :: Run tests
    cd apps\backend
    pytest --tb=short -v > test_results.log 2>&1
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo [ERROR] Backend tests failed. Check test_results.log for details.
        echo [%date% %time%] Backend tests failed >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        call venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat >nul 2>&1
        cd ..\..
        echo Press any key to return to menu...
        pause >nul
        exit /b 1
    ) else (
        echo [SUCCESS] Backend tests completed successfully.
        echo [%date% %time%] Backend tests completed >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        call venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat >nul 2>&1
        cd ..\..
        echo Press any key to continue...
        pause >nul
        exit /b 0
    )
) else (
    :: Handle other test types
    goto run_all_tests
)
```

### 5.7.4 Training Script Path Correction

One critical issue identified is that the training manager script attempts to execute a non-existent training script.

#### Problem
The `train-manager.bat` script tries to run `training\train.py`, but the actual training script is named `training\train_model.py`:
```batch
:: Current problematic implementation in train-manager.bat
if exist "training\train.py" (
    echo [INFO] Launching training script... (啟動訓練腳本)
    cd training
    python train.py
    cd ..
) else (
    echo [ERROR] Training script (train.py) not found
    echo [%date% %time%] Training script not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
)
```

#### Solution
Update the training manager script to use the correct training script path:
```batch
:: Fixed implementation
if exist "training\train_model.py" (
    echo [INFO] Launching training script... (啟動訓練腳本)
    cd training
    python train_model.py
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo [ERROR] Training script execution failed
        echo [%date% %time%] Training script execution failed >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    )
    cd ..
) else (
    echo [ERROR] Training script (train_model.py) not found
    echo [%date% %time%] Training script not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
)
```

### 5.7.5 Test Selection Logic Improvements

While the automatic test selection issue has been partially addressed, some scripts still have default behaviors that bypass user interaction.

#### Problem
The `run-tests.bat` script still defaults to running all tests when no test type is specified:
```batch
:: Current problematic implementation
if "%1"=="" (
    echo [INFO] No test type specified. Running all tests by default... (未指定測試類型。默認運行所有測試)
    set "test_type=all"
) else (
    set "test_type=%1"
)
```

#### Solution
Implement proper user interaction for test selection, ensuring users must make a choice:
```batch
:: Improved implementation with user interaction
if "%1"=="" (
    echo Available test options:
    echo   all      - Run all tests
    echo   backend  - Run backend tests only
    echo   frontend - Run frontend tests only
    echo   unit     - Run unit tests only
    echo   integration - Run integration tests only
    echo.
    set "test_type="
    set /p "test_type=Enter test type (or press Enter for all): "
    if not defined test_type set "test_type=all"
) else (
    set "test_type=%1"
)
```

### 5.7.6 Configuration File Handling and Default Settings

Several scripts have issues with configuration file handling and default settings that can cause unexpected behavior.

#### Problem
Scripts often assume certain files or configurations exist without proper validation, leading to errors like the training script path issue.

#### Solution
1. Implement proper configuration file validation:
```batch
:: Check for required configuration files
if not exist "training\configs\training_config.json" (
    echo [WARNING] Training configuration not found
    echo [INFO] Creating default configuration...
    :: Create default configuration or prompt user
)
```

2. Provide clear default settings with user confirmation:
```batch
:: Handle default settings with user interaction
if not defined user_preference (
    echo Default setting: %default_value%
    set /p "user_preference=Use default setting? (Y/N): "
    if /i "%user_preference%"=="N" (
        set /p "user_preference=Enter your preference: "
    ) else (
        set "user_preference=%default_value%"
    )
)
```

### 5.7.7 Path Resolution Improvements

Inconsistent path resolution methods across scripts can lead to execution failures in different environments.

#### Problem
Scripts use different methods for path resolution, some using relative paths and others using absolute paths derived from script location.

#### Solution
Standardize path resolution using `%~dp0` and ensure proper handling of trailing backslashes:
```batch
:: Use absolute paths derived from script location
set "PROJECT_ROOT=%~dp0"
if "%PROJECT_ROOT:~-1%"=="\" set "PROJECT_ROOT=%PROJECT_ROOT:~0,-1%"
cd /d "%PROJECT_ROOT%"

:: Consistent path references
set "TRAINING_DIR=%PROJECT_ROOT%\training"
set "SCRIPTS_DIR=%PROJECT_ROOT%\scripts"
```

### 5.7.8 Virtual Environment Management

Some scripts lack proper error handling when activating virtual environments.

#### Problem
Virtual environment activation may fail silently or without proper error reporting.

#### Solution
Implement robust virtual environment handling with proper error checking:
```batch
:: Check and activate virtual environment with error handling
if exist "%PROJECT_ROOT%\apps\backend\venv\Scripts\activate.bat" (
    call %PROJECT_ROOT%\apps\backend\venv\Scripts\activate.bat >nul 2>&1
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo [ERROR] Failed to activate virtual environment
        echo [%date% %time%] Failed to activate virtual environment >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
        exit /b 1
    )
) else (
    echo [ERROR] Virtual environment not found
    echo [%date% %time%] Virtual environment not found >> "%LOG_FILE%" 2>nul
    exit /b 1
)
```
